## What is Mostro App?

Mostro App is the official cross-platform client for the [Mostro](https://mostro.network) peer-to-peer exchange network. It lets anyone buy or sell Bitcoin for local fiat currency using the Lightning Network — without accounts, without KYC, and without trusting a third party.

**Key features:**

- **Non-custodial** — Your keys stay on your device. No exchange holds your funds.
- **Privacy-first** — End-to-end encrypted over Nostr: NIP-44 direct messages with the Mostro daemon, and a signed kind-14 envelope for peer-to-peer and dispute chat. Optional privacy mode hides reputation data.
- **Lightning-native** — All BTC settlements happen via Lightning invoices (BOLT 11). Supports [Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC)](https://nwc.dev) for automated invoice generation.
- **Censorship-resistant** — Built on the Nostr network; no central server or domain to block.
- **Multi-platform** — Single codebase targets Android, iOS, Web (PWA), macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Open source** — AGPLv3 licensed. Fully auditable, no proprietary components.

## What is Mostro?

Mostro is a decentralized peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange system. It acts as a **non-custodial escrow daemon** that facilitates trades between parties who want to exchange Bitcoin (via Lightning) for fiat currency.

Unlike centralized exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase), Mostro:

- Does not hold user funds or require registration
- Does not have access to trade secrets or personal data
- Cannot censor or block orders
- Relies on cryptographic proofs, not corporate trust
- Is run by independent operators — anyone can run a Mostro node

The Mostro daemon (server component) is an open-source project written in Rust: [MostroP2P/mostro](https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro). This repository is the **mobile/desktop/web client** that talks to any Mostro daemon.

---

## The Mostro Protocol

The Mostro protocol is a message-passing specification built on top of [Nostr](https://nostr.com). All communication between clients and the Mostro daemon travels as encrypted Nostr events.

### Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Order Book** | Mostro daemons publish pending orders as Nostr events of [Kind 38383](https://mostro.network/protocol/list_orders.html) — parameterized replaceable events. |
| **Trade Messages** | All trade actions (take order, add invoice, confirm fiat sent, release funds) are sent as NIP-44-encrypted direct messages — signed Kind 14 events authored by the per-trade key and directed to the Mostro node pubkey (Mostro protocol v2). |
| **P2P Chat** | Direct messages between buyer and seller (and dispute–admin chat) ride the [chat envelope](https://mostro.network/protocol/chat.html): a Kind 14 event signed with `K_sign` and `p`-tagged to `pub(K_conv)`, both derived from the trade-key ECDH secret, carrying a NIP-44 encrypted Kind 1 inner event signed by the sender's trade key. |
| **Hold Invoices** | The seller pays a Lightning hold invoice when taking a buy order. Funds are locked until the buyer confirms fiat receipt, then the daemon releases the HTLC. |
| **Reputation** | Each trade can result in a mutual star rating, published as a Nostr event by the daemon. |
| **Disputes** | Either party can open a dispute, escalating to a human Mostro operator for resolution. |

### Trade Flow

```
Maker creates order  →  Mostro daemon publishes Kind 38383 to relays
Taker sees order     →  sends "take-order" to daemon (NIP-44 direct, Kind 14)
Daemon responds      →  notifies both parties via NIP-44 direct DM (Kind 14)

Seller pays Lightning hold invoice (funds locked in HTLC)
Buyer submits Lightning invoice to receive sats

Fiat transfer happens off-chain (bank transfer, cash, etc.)

Buyer confirms "fiat-sent" (NIP-44 direct, Kind 14)
Seller confirms receipt  →  daemon settles hold invoice
Sats released to buyer   →  trade complete
Both parties rate each other (optional)
```

### Event Kinds Used

| Kind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `38383` | Public order book (published by Mostro daemon) |
| `14` | NIP-44 direct DM — encrypted trade messages to/from the daemon, signed by the trade key (Mostro protocol v2) |

### Protocol Reference

- Full spec: [mostro.network/protocol](https://mostro.network/protocol)
- NIP-44 Encrypted Payloads: [github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/44.md](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/44.md)
- Order Kind 38383: [mostro.network/protocol/list_orders.html](https://mostro.network/protocol/list_orders.html)

#### Supported NIPs & BUDs

| Spec | Used for |
|------|----------|
| [NIP-06](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/06.md) | Key derivation from a BIP-39 mnemonic (`rust/src/crypto/keys.rs`) |
| [NIP-13](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/13.md) | Proof-of-work mining on outgoing events, to the daemon's required difficulty (`rust/src/mostro/pow.rs`) |
| [NIP-44](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/44.md) | Encrypted payloads — daemon messages and the peer/dispute chat envelope (`rust/src/crypto/ecdh.rs`, `rust/src/nostr/transport.rs`) |
| [NIP-47](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/47.md) | Nostr Wallet Connect, for paying invoices from a connected wallet (`rust/src/nwc/client.rs`) |
| [NIP-69](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/69.md) | Public order-book status (`s` tag on Kind 38383) |
| [BUD-01](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/01.md) | Blob retrieval (`GET /<sha256>`) for encrypted file attachments (`rust/src/nostr/blossom.rs`) |

**Not used:** NIP-59 (gift wrap) was dropped from peer and dispute chat in #246/#254 — this client neither reads nor writes Kind 1059. Chat instead rides a custom Kind-14 envelope (see "P2P Chat" above), which is *not* NIP-17 despite sharing its kind number.

**Partial / known gap:** file uploads are not BUD-02 compliant as written — `try_upload` in `rust/src/nostr/blossom.rs` sends `PUT /{sha256}` instead of BUD-02's `PUT /upload`. Tracked in #341. The Kind-24242 authorization event is implemented correctly (that mechanism is [BUD-11](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/11.md), not BUD-02 — the code comment mislabels this too, also noted in #341); only the upload path itself is wrong. File content encryption (ChaCha20-Poly1305) happens application-side before upload and is not part of any BUD.

---

## Architecture & Fundamentals

Mostro App uses a **split-architecture** model: all cryptography, protocol logic, and network I/O live in a Rust core; the UI shell is written in Flutter/Dart.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Design Principles

- **Offline-first** — Orders and trade state persist locally; outbound messages are queued and retried when relay connectivity is restored.
- **Identity via BIP-32/39** — The master identity key is derived from a BIP-39 mnemonic. Per-trade ephemeral keys are derived via BIP-32 path `m/44'/1237'/38383'/0/N` to prevent cross-trade correlation.
- **Zero server dependency** — The app can function with any compliant Mostro node. The default node pubkey is configurable in settings.
- **Type-safe bridge** — The Rust API surface is defined through `flutter_rust_bridge` annotations; all Dart–Rust interactions are generated, never hand-written.
- **Platform parity** — Web builds use `wasm-pack` to compile the Rust core to WASM; storage and async runtime are feature-gated per target.

## Getting Started (Users)

### Install the App

**Android**

Download the latest APK from the [Releases](../../releases) page and install it, or build from source (see the Developer section below).

**iOS**

Available via TestFlight (link in Releases) or build from source with Xcode.

**Web**

Open **<https://mostro.network/app/>** in a modern browser — it always serves the latest
build of `main`. No native app is installed and nothing is uploaded: the identity is generated
in your browser and stays there, and the app talks to Nostr relays directly.
(`https://mostrop2p.github.io/app/` redirects there.)

The very first visit reloads itself once while it installs the service worker that supplies
the cross-origin isolation headers the Rust core needs; that is expected. Two requirements
follow from it: the page must be loaded over **HTTPS** (a service worker needs a secure
context), and a browser with service workers disabled cannot run the web client.

**Desktop (macOS / Windows / Linux)**

Download the binary for your platform from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

### First Run

1. On first launch, the app generates a BIP-39 mnemonic seed phrase.
2. **Back up your seed phrase immediately** — it is the only way to recover your identity and trade history.
3. Configure your preferred Mostro node pubkey and Nostr relays in **Settings → Relays**.
4. (Optional) Connect a Lightning wallet via **Settings → Connect Wallet** (Nostr Wallet Connect) for automated invoice handling.

### Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MostroP2P/app.git
cd app

# Install Dart/Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Install the flutter_rust_bridge codegen CLI at the pinned version.
# It MUST match `flutter_rust_bridge` in pubspec.yaml and rust/Cargo.toml (2.11.1):
# a mismatched CLI generates bindings that fail to compile, with an error that
# never mentions versions. Re-running this is cheap if it is already installed.
cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --version 2.11.1 --locked

# Verify the Rust core compiles
cd rust && cargo build && cd ..

# Regenerate flutter_rust_bridge bindings (needed after any Rust API change).
# The wrapper checks your CLI against the pin before generating.
./scripts/frb-generate.sh
```

### Run

```bash
# Auto-detect connected device
flutter run

# Target a specific platform
flutter run -d android
flutter run -d ios
flutter run -d chrome        # Web — needs extra steps, see "Running on Web" below
flutter run -d macos
flutter run -d windows
flutter run -d linux
```

### Running on Web

Web needs two steps that the other platforms don't. On native, the Flutter build
compiles the Rust core for you; on web it does **not** — you compile the Rust core to
WebAssembly yourself, and the page must be served with cross-origin isolation headers.
Skip either step and the app builds but shows a **blank page**.

**One-time prerequisites** — in addition to the table above. The wasm build compiles
the Rust core with `-Z build-std`, which requires a nightly toolchain with `rust-src`
(and the wasm target on that same nightly toolchain):

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
cargo install wasm-pack
```

**1. Compile the Rust core to WASM.** This produces `web/pkg/` (`rust.js` +
`rust_bg.wasm`). Re-run it after any change under `rust/src/`:

```bash
./scripts/build-web.sh              # add --release for an optimized build
```

Do **not** run `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen build-web` directly: on current nightly it
silently produces WASM without shared memory, which crashes at runtime with
`DataCloneError: ... #<Memory> could not be cloned` when FRB spawns its worker pool.
The script adds the required linker flags and verifies the output (see issue #212).

If you skip this step entirely, the console shows `Refused to execute script from
'.../pkg/rust.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable` — the WASM was
never built.

**2. Run in Chrome with cross-origin isolation headers.** The Rust core uses
`SharedArrayBuffer`, which browsers enable only under COOP/COEP:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome \
  --web-header "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy=same-origin" \
  --web-header "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy=require-corp"
```

Without the headers the console shows `Buffers cannot be shared due to missing
cross-origin headers` and the page stays blank.

On first launch the app generates an identity and connects to relays; you should see the
order book populate from the daemon's Kind 38383 events without running anything locally.

### Deploying the web client

`main` is published automatically to **<https://mostro.network/app/>** by
[`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) on every merge.
(The organization serves its Pages sites from that domain, so this project page lives under
`mostro.network/app/` rather than `mostrop2p.github.io/app/`, which 301s to it. The sub-path
is the same either way.)
The build itself lives in the reusable
[`.github/workflows/web-build.yml`](.github/workflows/web-build.yml), which the deploy calls
and **CI also runs on every pull request** — so a change that breaks the web target fails
before it lands, and what CI validates cannot drift from what ships. It runs the same steps as
above (`scripts/frb-generate.sh`, then `scripts/build-web.sh --release`) and finishes with:

```bash
flutter build web --release --base-href "/app/" --pwa-strategy=none
```

It then verifies the bundle and smoke-tests it in headless Chrome
([`test/web/smoke/smoke.mjs`](test/web/smoke/smoke.mjs)): the release bundle is served
cross-origin isolated under `/app/`, and the test asserts the page is isolated, the Flutter
view mounted, a Rust bridge call returned, and nothing errored. Static checks alone cannot
catch that — every blank-page cause below greps perfectly clean.

Three things make it work on a static host that cannot set HTTP headers:

- **`web/coi-serviceworker.min.js`** (vendored, MIT — see `web/coi-serviceworker.LICENSE`)
  is loaded as the first script in `web/index.html`. It installs a service worker that
  re-serves every request with the COOP/COEP headers injected, which is what makes
  `SharedArrayBuffer` — and therefore the Rust core's wasm threads — available. The cost is
  one automatic reload on a visitor's first load. It stays out of the way during local
  development, where the headers already come from `--web-header`.
- **`--base-href "/app/"`** — project pages are served from a sub-path; without it every
  asset 404s and the page is blank.
- **`--pwa-strategy=none`** — Flutter's own (deprecated) service worker would register over
  the same scope and evict the isolation shim, silently un-isolating the page. Offline
  caching is the trade-off. The app is still installable from the browser (Install app,
  or Add to Home Screen on iOS): that comes from `web/manifest.json` and its icons, not
  from that worker. The icons are generated from the Mostro art by `flutter_launcher_icons`
  (see its `web` block in `pubspec.yaml`).

The shim registers a service worker, which browsers only allow in a **secure context** — the
site has to be reachable over HTTPS (Pages: *Settings → Pages → Enforce HTTPS*), or the page
loads un-isolated and stays blank.

Deploying elsewhere works too, but the bundle is not portable across paths: `--base-href`
is baked in at build time, so rebuild with the path the site is actually served from
(`/` at a domain root, `/whatever/` under a sub-path). What carries over unchanged is the
isolation choice — either set `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and
`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` at the server/CDN and drop the shim, or keep
the shim and let it supply them.

### Build for Production

```bash
# Android APK
flutter build apk --release

# Android App Bundle (Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release

# Web — compile the Rust core first (see "Running on Web"), then:
./scripts/build-web.sh --release
flutter build web --release --base-href "/app/" --pwa-strategy=none

# macOS
flutter build macos --release

# Windows
flutter build windows --release

# Linux
flutter build linux --release
```

### Testing

```bash
# Rust unit tests
cargo test

# Rust linter (must pass with zero warnings)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Flutter static analysis
flutter analyze

# Flutter tests
flutter test
```

All CI checks must pass before merging. Run both suites locally before opening a PR.

### Regenerating the Bridge

If you modify any `#[frb]`-annotated Rust function in `rust/src/api/`:

```bash
./scripts/frb-generate.sh
```

This wraps `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate` and refuses to run when your local codegen CLI does not match the version pinned in `pubspec.yaml` — generating with a mismatched CLI produces bindings that fail to compile. Pass `--check` to verify without generating.

> **Do not hand-edit** files under `lib/src/rust/` — they are auto-generated and will be overwritten on the next codegen run. They are **committed**: commit the regenerated files in the same commit as the `rust/src/api/` change, and CI fails if they drift. See [CONTRIBUTING.md → Generated code](CONTRIBUTING.md#generated-code), which also covers resolving conflicts in them.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please read this section before opening an issue or pull request.

### Reporting Bugs

1. Search [existing issues](../../issues) first to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new issue using the **Bug Report** template.
3. Include: platform, Flutter/Rust versions, reproduction steps, and relevant logs (`flutter run --verbose` or `adb logcat`).

### Requesting Features

1. Open a [Feature Request](../../issues/new) issue.
2. Describe the use case — what problem does it solve and who benefits?
3. Features that align with the Mostro protocol roadmap are prioritized.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Follow the code style:**
   - Dart: standard Flutter conventions, enforced by `analysis_options.yaml`
   - Rust: `cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (zero warnings required)
   - Commits: use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`

3. **Write tests** for any new Rust API functions. Flutter widget tests are encouraged for new screens.

4. **Keep PRs focused** — one concern per PR. Large refactors should be discussed in an issue first.

5. **Ensure all checks pass locally** before pushing:
   ```bash
   cargo test && cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   flutter analyze && flutter test
   ```

6. Open the PR against `main`, fill in the PR template, and link the related issue.

7. Maintainers will review within a few days. Address feedback with new commits — do not force-push a branch under review.

### Branch Policy

| Branch pattern | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `main` | Protected — requires passing CI and one approving review |
| `feat/<name>` | New features |
| `fix/<name>` | Bug fixes |
| `docs/<name>` | Documentation only |
| `refactor/<name>` | Code restructuring without behavior change |

### Development Notes

- **Bridge changes:** Any modification to `rust/src/api/` requires re-running `./scripts/frb-generate.sh` and committing the regenerated files with the change. For conflicts in them, see [CONTRIBUTING.md → Generated code](CONTRIBUTING.md#generated-code).
- **Serde conventions:** `mostro-core` uses `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]` — all protocol status strings on the wire are kebab-case (e.g., `"waiting-buyer-invoice"`, `"fiat-sent"`, `"in-progress"`).
- **`pub` vs `pub(crate)`:** Only types that must be exposed to the Dart bridge should be `pub`. Internal helpers and types wrapping `nostr-sdk` structs should be `pub(crate)` to prevent broken FRB stub generation.
- **Key derivation:** Per-trade keys follow BIP-32 path `m/44'/1237'/38383'/0/N`. Never reuse the master identity key for trade-level messages.
- **Offline-first:** New trade actions must go through the outbound message queue (`rust/src/queue/`) so they are retried on reconnect. Do not call the relay client directly from action handlers.

### Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). Be respectful, constructive, and inclusive. Violations can be reported to the maintainers via the contact listed in the GitHub organization profile.

## Internationalization

The app is localized in:

| Language | Code | File |
|----------|------|------|
| English | `en` | `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` |
| Spanish | `es` | `lib/l10n/app_es.arb` |
| Italian | `it` | `lib/l10n/app_it.arb` |
| French | `fr` | `lib/l10n/app_fr.arb` |
| German | `de` | `lib/l10n/app_de.arb` |
| Dutch | `nl` | `lib/l10n/app_nl.arb` |

To add a new language:

1. Copy `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` to `lib/l10n/app_<code>.arb`
2. Translate all string values (keep the `"@@locale"` key correct)
3. Run `flutter gen-l10n` to regenerate the Dart localizations — it auto-detects the new `.arb` file (no `l10n.yaml` change needed)
4. Register the language in the places that keep their own list:
   - `lib/features/settings/widgets/language_selector.dart`: the English and native name in `languageNames` (the picker already lists every `.arb` file; without a name it shows the bare code)
   - `rust/src/api/settings.rs`: the code in `SUPPORTED_LOCALES`, then `./scripts/frb-generate.sh`
   - `web/push_worker_logic.js`: the locale's `pushNewMessageBody` in `CHAT_WAKE_BODIES` (a service worker cannot read `.arb` files)
   - `specs/006-announcement-channel/spec.md`: the locales every announcement must carry, in the rule and in the JSON example
5. Run `flutter test` and `cargo test`: `test/l10n/locale_lists_test.dart` checks the picker names, the Rust list, the push worker and spec 006 against the `.arb` files, so a place missed in step 4 fails there
6. Open a PR — translation contributions are always welcome

## Security

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue.** Instead:

- Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](../../security/advisories/new) (preferred), or
- Email the maintainers directly via the contact in the GitHub organization profile.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide a fix within 30 days for critical issues.

### Security Model

- **Keys never leave the device** — the BIP-39 seed is stored in platform secure storage (`flutter_secure_storage`, backed by Android Keystore / iOS Keychain / Linux SecretService).
- **End-to-end encrypted trade messages** — all communication between the app and the Mostro daemon uses NIP-44 encrypted direct messages (secp256k1 ECDH + ChaCha20 + HMAC-SHA256). Peer-to-peer and dispute chat use the signed kind-14 chat envelope, whose author is pinned to the conversation key so third parties cannot inject messages.
- **Per-trade ephemeral keys** — a new BIP-32 child key is derived for each trade, preventing cross-trade correlation even if a single trade key is compromised.
- **The Mostro daemon never sees plaintext** — all messages are encrypted to the daemon's public key; only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt them.
- **No telemetry** — the app does not collect analytics, crash reports, or any usage data.
