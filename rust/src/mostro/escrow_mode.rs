//! Which settlement backend the active Mostro node runs — Lightning or Cashu.

//! Phase C1 of `docs/cashu/README.md`. This is the gate every later Cashu phase
//! hangs off: nothing Cashu-shaped may run, and no Cashu UI may appear, unless
//! the active node has been *positively identified* as running Cashu escrow.
//!
//! Same shape as [`crate::mostro::pow`] — a process-global refreshed from the
//! daemon's Kind 38385 info event whenever the relay pool comes online or the
//! active node changes. Unlike PoW this one is tri-state, mirroring
//! `BondPolicy` on the Dart side (`lib/features/about/models/mostro_instance.dart`):
//! an old daemon that predates the tags is [`EscrowMode::Unknown`], which is
//! **not** the same as knowing it speaks Lightning.
//!
//! Fail-safe by construction: [`is_cashu_mode`] is the only way to ask whether
//! the wallet and escrow paths may run, and it answers `false` for `Unknown`,
//! for `Lightning`, and for a Cashu node that does not pin a single mint. A
