//! Escrow primitives — phase C4 of `docs/cashu/README.md`.
//!
//! The cryptographic heart of Cashu-mode trading, deliberately UI-free so a
//! review can be about correctness and nothing else.
//!
//! The escrow is a NUT-11 P2PK secret locked 2-of-3 (§2 of the doc):
//!
//! ```text
//! data          = P_S                      (seller)
//! pubkeys       = [P_B, P_M]               (buyer, Mostro)
//! n_sigs        = 2                        (any two of the three)
//! sigflag       = SIG_INPUTS
//! locktime      = now + escrow_locktime_days
//! refund        = [P_S]                    (seller alone, after locktime)
//! n_sigs_refund = 1
//! ```
//!
//! Two things this module exists to get right, both of which fail silently if
//! wrong:
//!
//! - **Key encoding.** Nostr trade keys are x-only (32 bytes); Cashu P2PK wants
//!   compressed SEC1 (33 bytes). The daemon prefixes `02`
//!   (`cashu_pubkey_from_xonly_hex`) and the client must do the identical
//!   thing, or the token locks to a key nobody holds.
//! - **Per-order keys.** Every party is identified by the *trade* key for that
//!   order, never the identity key. That is a privacy requirement of the
//!   upstream spec, not a preference.
