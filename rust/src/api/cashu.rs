//! Cashu wallet surface for the UI — phase C2 of `docs/cashu/README.md`.
//!
//! Holds the single process-wide wallet, gates every entry point on the escrow
//! mode, and broadcasts changes so the UI never polls.
//!
//! **Nothing here runs on a Lightning node.** Every function returns
//! `CashuNotEnabled` unless [`crate::mostro::escrow_mode::is_cashu_mode`] is
//! true, which requires the active node to have advertised Cashu *and* a usable

//! Errors are stable markers (`CashuNotEnabled`, `CashuNotConnected`,
//! `CashuMintUnreachable`, …); Dart maps them to localized strings.
