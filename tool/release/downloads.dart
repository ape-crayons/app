Both need **Android 7.0 (API 24) or later** and are the same app: an APK holds
native machine code (the Flutter engine and Mostro's Rust core, which does all
the cryptography), and one file per CPU instruction set keeps each download to
a fraction of the size of a universal APK. Every release is signed with the
same key, so it installs over the previous version and keeps your data.

<details>
<summary><b>Which APK is mine?</b></summary>

- **`arm64-v8a` (v8)** targets the 64-bit ARMv8-A instruction set. Practically
  every phone released since 2016–2017 runs a 64-bit Android, Google Play has
  required 64-bit builds since August 2019, and recent devices — the Pixel 7
  and later, and any phone built on 2023-or-newer Arm cores — are
  **64-bit only**: they cannot run the v7 APK at all. 64-bit code is also
  noticeably faster at the elliptic-curve and encryption work the app does.
- **`armeabi-v7a` (v7)** targets 32-bit ARMv7-A with hardware floating point.
  It is for phones with a 32-bit CPU (Cortex-A7/A9/A15 class, roughly 2015
  and earlier) **and** for phones whose 64-bit-capable CPU ships with a
  32-bit Android — common in budget and Android Go models with 2 GB of RAM
  or less.
- **To be sure:** try v8 first. If Android answers *"App not installed"* or
  *"package is not compatible with your phone"*, install v7. With a computer,
  `adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abilist` prints the supported ABIs —
  if `arm64-v8a` is in the list, use v8.
- x86 devices (emulators, some Chromebooks) are not covered by these builds.

<summary><b>Linux</b> — unpack and run</summary>

```bash
mkdir mostro && tar -xzf mostro-*-linux-x64.tar.gz -C mostro && ./mostro/mostro
```

Keep the folder together: the `mostro` binary loads `lib/` and `data/` from
next to itself. It needs GTK 3 and **libsecret** with a running keyring
(GNOME Keyring, KWallet) — that is where your keys are stored.

To add Mostro to your application menu, with its icon, run
`./mostro/install.sh` once (again after moving the folder;
`--uninstall` removes it). On Wayland the app shows a generic icon until then.

<summary><b>Windows</b> — unzip and run <code>mostro.exe</code></summary>

Unzip the whole folder and start `mostro.exe` from inside it; the DLLs and
`data\\` next to it are part of the app. The build carries no Authenticode
signature, so **SmartScreen** shows *"Windows protected your PC"*: choose
**More info → Run anyway**. Check the file against `SHA256SUMS.txt` first.

<details>
<summary><b>macOS</b> — allow an app Apple has not notarized</summary>

The app is ad-hoc signed and **not notarized**, so Gatekeeper refuses it on a
double click (*"cannot be opened"* or *"is damaged"*). After checking the zip
against `SHA256SUMS.txt`, unzip it, move `mostro.app` to Applications and
clear the quarantine flag once:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/mostro.app
```

<summary><b>iOS</b> — for sideloading only</summary>

This `.ipa` is **unsigned**: iOS will not install it as it is, and it is not a
TestFlight or App Store build. It is meant to sideload with a tool that
re-signs it with your own Apple ID (AltStore, Sideloadly, or Xcode). Apps
signed with a free Apple ID expire after 7 days, and **push notifications do
not work** in a re-signed build — they need the project's own provisioning
profile.
