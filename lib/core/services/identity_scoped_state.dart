/// this is the Dart half. These providers cache what they read — the trade
/// list, chat rooms, decrypted attachments, disputes, per-order roles — and
/// none of them is `autoDispose`, so without this the previous user's trades
/// and chats stay on screen until the app restarts, whatever the database
/// says.

/// Device preferences are not identity data and stay: theme, language, the
/// node and relay choice, the NWC wallet connection, the Cashu wallet's mint,

/// user's session.
///
/// Takes the app's [ProviderContainer], not a widget's `ref`: the swap runs
/// across bridge calls long enough for the screen that started it to be
/// disposed, and a disposed widget's `ref` throws.
