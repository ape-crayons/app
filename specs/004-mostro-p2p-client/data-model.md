# Data Model: Mostro Mobile v2

**Branch**: `001-mostro-p2p-client` | **Date**: 2026-03-22

## Entities

### Identity

Represents the user's cryptographic identity. One per app installation.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| public_key | String | Nostr public key (hex) |
| encrypted_private_key | Bytes | Private key encrypted with user's PIN/passphrase |
| mnemonic_hash | String | Hash of mnemonic for verification (never store plaintext) |
| display_name | String? | Optional user-chosen display name |
| created_at | Timestamp | When identity was created |
| last_used_at | Timestamp | Last activity timestamp |
| trade_key_index | u32 | Current BIP-32 trade key index (N in m/44'/1237'/38383'/0/N) |
| privacy_mode | bool | Whether user is in privacy mode (no reputation). **Authoritative source.** The Settings `privacy_mode` key is a convenience alias: writes MUST go through `set_privacy_mode()` on the Identity API, which updates Identity first and then propagates to Settings. On read, Identity.privacy_mode wins any conflict. Settings MUST NOT be written directly for this key. |
| derivation_path | String | BIP-32 base path: `m/44'/1237'/38383'/0` |

**Validation rules**:
- `public_key` MUST be a valid 64-char hex string (32 bytes).
- `encrypted_private_key` MUST never be stored as plaintext.
- Mnemonic MUST be BIP-39 compliant (12 or 24 words).
- `trade_key_index` starts at 0 (master) and auto-increments per trade.

---

### Order

A buy or sell offer on the Mostro network.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Mostro order ID |
| kind | Enum | `Buy` or `Sell` |
| status | Enum | See state machine below |
| amount_sats | u64? | Amount in satoshis (null if fiat-defined) |
| fiat_amount | f64? | Fixed amount in fiat (null if range order) |
| fiat_amount_min | f64? | Min fiat amount for range orders (null if fixed) |
| fiat_amount_max | f64? | Max fiat amount for range orders (null if fixed) |
| fiat_code | String | ISO 4217 currency code (e.g., "USD", "EUR") |
| payment_method | String | Fiat payment method description |
| premium | f64 | Price premium/discount percentage |
| creator_pubkey | String | Public key of order creator |
| created_at | Timestamp | When order was created: the Kind 38383 `published_at` tag, else the legacy `created_at` tag, else the event's `created_at`; a tag value is capped at the event's `created_at` |
| expires_at | Timestamp? | Expiration time (null if no expiry) |
| nostr_event_id | String? | Kind 38383 event ID on relay |
| is_mine | bool | Whether current user created this order |
| cached_at | Timestamp | When this order was last fetched/updated locally |
| rating | f64 | Maker reputation from the Kind 38383 `rating` tag (`total_rating`, 0–5; 0.0 = no reputation: full privacy (`none`), missing tag, or malformed/invalid data) |
| total_reviews | u32 | Number of reviews behind `rating` (`total_reviews`) |
| days_active | u32 | Days the maker has been active on the node (`days`, deprecated on the wire; the display fallback when `maker_since` is absent) |
| maker_since | i64? | The maker's first trade (`since`): Unix seconds, truncated to the UTC day start. Null from daemons that predate it. The UI shows the age computed at display time (now − `maker_since`, whole days, never negative) and falls back to `days_active` |

**Validation rules**:
- `fiat_code` MUST be a valid ISO 4217 code.
- Either `fiat_amount` OR both `fiat_amount_min` and `fiat_amount_max` MUST be provided, but NOT both. If `fiat_amount` is present, `fiat_amount_min` and `fiat_amount_max` MUST be absent; if `fiat_amount_min`/`fiat_amount_max` are present, `fiat_amount` MUST be absent.
- If range: `fiat_amount_min` MUST be > 0 and < `fiat_amount_max`.
- `premium` is a signed float (negative = discount).
- `rating` MUST be within 0–5. Each reputation field (`rating`, `total_reviews`, `days_active`) is validated independently: an out-of-range, non-integer, or malformed value degrades that field alone to 0, and the order is never rejected because of its `rating` tag. `maker_since` is likewise validated alone: anything but a positive integer that fits i64 leaves it null.

**State machine** (15 mostro-core states):
```text
Pending
├─→ WaitingBuyerInvoice (sell orders: buyer must provide invoice)
│     └─→ WaitingPayment (buy orders skip WaitingBuyerInvoice, go here directly)
│           ├─→ Active
│           │     ├─→ FiatSent
│           │     │     └─→ SettledHoldInvoice → Success
│           │     │           (if LN payment fails: Action::PaymentFailed notification,
│           │     │            order stays SettledHoldInvoice, buyer resubmits invoice)
│           │     └─→ Dispute
│           │           ├─→ InProgress (admin took dispute)
│           │           ├─→ CanceledByAdmin
│           │           ├─→ SettledByAdmin
│           │           ├─→ CompletedByAdmin
│           │           └─→ (direct admin resolution without InProgress)
│           └─→ Expired (protocol-enforced inactivity timeout)
├─→ Canceled (explicit user action: creator cancels own untaken order)
└─→ CooperativelyCanceled (in mostro-core Status enum; set client-side via action notifications — the daemon does not send a status update for this transition)
```

**15 mostro-core statuses**: Pending, WaitingBuyerInvoice, WaitingPayment, Active, FiatSent,
SettledHoldInvoice, Success, Canceled, CooperativelyCanceled, Dispute, InProgress,
SettledByAdmin, CanceledByAdmin, CompletedByAdmin, Expired.

This is the protocol state machine, which only daemon messages expose in full.
The public Kind 38383 event carries NIP-69's four-bucket view instead, so an
`InProgress` reaching this client stands for "taken, real state unknown" rather
than for the admin-took-dispute transition above. See "Public status vs. trade
status" in `contracts/orders.md`.

### Trade

An active transaction linking buyer, seller, and order. Only one active
trade at a time (v2.0 scope constraint).

Stored as one row per trade: `id` is the primary key and every other field
lives inside a JSON-serialised `TradeInfo` in `data`. There is **no
`order_id` column** — the order's id sits in that blob at `$.order.id`, which
is why the schema carries an expression index over it.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | **The row's own id, not the order's.** A take made on this device mints a fresh UUID here while `$.order.id` holds the id the daemon knows; a row rebuilt rather than taken — a replayed daemon message on a fresh device, a restored bond — reuses the order id for both. So the two may match or diverge, and neither case says whose row it is (`order.is_mine` and `role` carry that). No trade lookup uses this field: it exists so `save_trade` replaces a row instead of inserting a second one, which is why a rebuild carries it forward rather than minting a new one (issue #395) |
| order.id | UUID | The daemon's id for the order, inside `data`. **Every accessor keys on this** — read, update, delete, and the chat's `messages.trade_id` — whether or not it equals the row's `id`. `get_trade`, which keyed on the primary key and so missed the rows where they diverge, was removed |
| role | Enum | `Buyer` or `Seller` |
| counterparty_pubkey | String | Other party's public key |
| current_step | Enum | Current progress step (see below) |
| hold_invoice | String? | Lightning hold invoice (bolt11) delivered by mostrod via a Kind 14 (NIP-44) message with `Action::PayInvoice` + `Payload::PaymentRequest`; persisted via `db.update_trade_fields` into `trades.data` (`$.hold_invoice`) so the pay-invoice UI can render the QR |
| buyer_invoice | String? | Buyer-provided invoice for sell orders |
| trade_key_index | u32 | BIP-32 key index for this trade |
| shared_key | String? | ECDH-derived key for P2P chat (hex) |
| cooperative_cancel_state | Enum? | `RequestedByMe`, `RequestedByPeer`, `Accepted`, null |
| timeout_at | Timestamp? | When current state times out (set on take: `now + 900`; used by the stale-state sweep as its age gate) |
| started_at | Timestamp | When trade began |
| completed_at | Timestamp? | When the trade completed with `success` (issue #642): recorded (`db.mark_trade_completed`, first write wins, never later than now) before the `success` is written, from the `created_at` of what carried it — the buyer's `purchase-completed`, or the Kind 38383 `success` revision for the seller. Null while active, for every other ending, and for a `success` completed before #642 or at an unknown time; an admin verdict that later refines a replayed `success` leaves it in place. Dates the peer chat's one-hour grace window, which only a `success` row opens (`contracts/messages.md`) |
| outcome | Enum? | `Success`, `Canceled`, `Expired`, `DisputeWon`, `DisputeLost` |
| rated_at | Timestamp? | When the local user rated the counterparty; durable marker written by `db.mark_trade_rated` after `submit_rating` publishes (issue #339), and when the daemon's `rate-received` (sent to the rater alone) arrives or is replayed — dated by the event. `rate-received` lives only as long as the relays keep it, so the in-memory `RATING_STORE` rehydrates from this on restart — the store stays the cache, this is authoritative on load. The score itself is not persisted: a rehydrated rating carries a placeholder `0`, which the UI never shows as a score (`myRatingScore`) |
| bond | BondInfo? | Anti-abuse bond the node required for this trade (`docs/ANTI_ABUSE_BOND.md` §7.1): `role` (`Maker`/`Taker`), `amount_sats`, `invoice` (the bond bolt11, `None` after a fresh-device restore), `state` (`Requested`/`Locked`/`Released`/`Slashed`), `requested_at`, `expires_at` (decoded from the bolt11), `locked_at`. Null on nodes without bonds and on rows written before the field |

Trade rows are history: they are updated in place (`status`,
`hold_invoice`, `amount_sats` — see `update_trade_fields`) but never
deleted, with one exception: a trade canceled by the daemon while still
in pending/waiting states (never active) is **deleted** rather than kept
(see `contracts/orders.md` — Daemon cancellation semantics).

**Buyer progress steps**: `OrderTaken`, `PayInvoice`, `PaymentLocked`,
`FiatSent`, `AwaitingRelease`, `Complete`

**Seller progress steps**: `OrderPublished`, `TakerFound`, `InvoiceCreated`,
`PaymentLocked`, `AwaitingFiat`, `Complete`

**Special step**: `Disputed` (overlays any step, pauses normal flow)

**Bond windows**: a trade whose `order.status` is `WaitingTakerBond` or
`WaitingMakerBond` has not started its trade flow; the bond is outstanding.
Neither status is ever on the public book. An unpaid window is closed locally
once `bond.expires_at` passes; a maker's also closes at the order's own
`expires_at`, whichever comes first. A bond already `Locked` never expires.

**Validation rules**:
- `counterparty_pubkey` MUST differ from current user's public key.
- Only one trade with `completed_at = null` allowed at any time.

---

### Message

An encrypted communication between trade parties or with admin during
disputes. Persisted locally after decryption.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| trade_id | UUID | The **order id**, which is what the chat keys are derived from — deliberately **not** a foreign key to `trades(id)`: a row whose own id diverges from its order's would fail that check and lose its history on restart (issue #246) |
| sender_pubkey | String | Sender's public key |
| recipient_pubkey | String | Recipient's public key |
| content | String | Decrypted message text |
| message_type | Enum | `Peer`, `Admin`, `System` |
| is_mine | bool | Whether current user sent this |
| is_read | bool | Whether user has seen this message |
| created_at | Timestamp | When message was sent |
| received_at | Timestamp | When message was received locally |
| nostr_event_id | String? | Incoming event ID for dedup (Kind 14 — from the daemon, or a peer-chat envelope) |

**Validation rules**:
- `content` MUST not be empty.
- `nostr_event_id` used to deduplicate messages received from multiple relays.

---

### Relay

A Nostr relay the app connects to.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| url | String | WebSocket URL (wss://...) |
| is_active | bool | Whether app should connect to this relay |
| is_default | bool | Whether this is a preconfigured default |
| source | Enum | `Default`, `MostroDiscovered`, `UserAdded` |
| is_blacklisted | bool | If true, relay will not be auto-added even if daemon announces it |
| status | Enum | `Connected`, `Disconnected`, `Connecting`, `Error` |
| last_connected_at | Timestamp? | Last successful connection |
| last_error | String? | Most recent error message |
| added_at | Timestamp | When relay was added |

**Validation rules**:
- `url` MUST be a valid WebSocket URL (wss:// or ws://).
- At least one relay MUST be active at all times.

---

### Dispute

An exception flow on an active trade.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key — the daemon's dispute id when we opened it (see below) |
| trade_id | UUID | FK → Trade |
| initiated_by | Enum | `Me` or `Counterparty` |
| reason | String? | Optional reason text |
| status | Enum | `Open`, `InReview`, `Resolved` |
| resolution | Enum? | `FundsToMe`, `FundsToCounterparty`, `CooperativeCancel` |
| opened_at | Timestamp | When dispute was opened |
| resolved_at | Timestamp? | When dispute was resolved |

**Validation rules**:
- A dispute can only be opened on a trade with `current_step` between
  `PaymentLocked` and `AwaitingRelease`/`AwaitingFiat`.
- Only one open dispute per trade.

**On `id`**: for a dispute we opened, this is the UUID the daemon assigned and
returned in its acceptance — the same id its Kind 38386 dispute event and the
solver use. A record created for a **peer-opened** dispute (built from
`admin-took-dispute`, which is the first the counterparty hears of it) still
gets a locally minted UUID, so the two sides currently know the same dispute
under different ids.

---

### BondClaim

The user's share of a counterparty's slashed anti-abuse bond, claimable with a
Lightning invoice (`docs/ANTI_ABUSE_BOND.md` §6.4, `contracts/bond.md`).
Created by the daemon's `add-bond-invoice`. **Independent of Trade**: it has no
foreign key, and it outlives the trade row, which may be completed, canceled or
wiped by the time the claim arrives.

Stored in `bond_claims` (SQLite table, IndexedDB store), keyed
`<node_pubkey>:<order_id>`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| order_id | UUID | The order whose counterparty's bond was slashed |
| node_pubkey | String | The issuing node, and the target of the submission even after a node switch |
| trade_index | u32? | Key index the request was addressed to (the slashed attempt's); null on rows stored before it was recorded |
| amount_sats | u64 | The share on offer; the invoice must be for exactly this |
| slashed_at | Timestamp | When the daemon slashed the bond |
| deadline_at | Timestamp | `slashed_at` + the node's claim window (default 15 days), frozen on first receipt |
| phase | Enum | `Pending`, `Submitted`, `Acknowledged`, `Completed`, `Expired` |
| submitted_invoice | String? | The bolt11 sent |
| fiat_code | String | Display only |
| fiat_amount | f64? | Display only |
| payment_method | String | Display only |
| updated_at | Timestamp | Last change; list order |

**Validation rules**:
- A cadence retry of `add-bond-invoice` never re-arms a `Submitted` claim; a
  re-prompt after `Acknowledged` does.
- `Completed` is terminal. `Expired` is terminal once `deadline_at` has
  passed; a re-prompt inside the frozen deadline reopens it as `Pending`.
- A request with a different `slashed_at` for the same (node, order) replaces
  the claim, with a deadline computed afresh.

---

### Settings

User preferences stored locally.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| key | String | Setting identifier (PK) |
| value | String | JSON-encoded setting value |
| updated_at | Timestamp | Last modification |

**Known keys**: `theme` (dark/light/system), `locale` (language code),
`pin_enabled` (bool), `biometric_enabled` (bool),
`default_fiat_currency` (ISO code), `notification_enabled` (bool),
`privacy_mode` (bool — global toggle, applies to future trades),
`logging_enabled` (bool — verbose diagnostic logging, runtime-only in the Rust
store: the Flutter layer persists it and re-applies it on launch, so the user's
choice survives a restart), `bond_claim_retained_nodes` (JSON map of node
pubkey → unix seconds: nodes the user switched away from, kept on the kind-14
filter until then so a claim they issue still arrives), `push_enabled`,
`push_token`, `push_platform`, `push_registrations` and `push_node_refusals`
(push registration state, `contracts/push.md`).

---

### MessageQueue (offline outbox)

Outgoing messages queued when offline.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| event_json | String | Serialized outbound Nostr event (Kind 14 NIP-44 throughout: daemon actions, and the chat envelope for peer chat) |
| target_relays | String | JSON array of relay URLs to publish to |
| created_at | Timestamp | When queued |
| retry_count | u32 | Number of send attempts |
| last_retry_at | Timestamp? | Last attempt timestamp |
| status | Enum | `Pending`, `Sent`, `Failed` |

**Validation rules**:
- `retry_count` MUST not exceed configurable max (default: 10).
- `Sent` items SHOULD be pruned after 24 hours.

### NwcWallet

A Nostr Wallet Connect wallet connection for automatic invoice payment.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| wallet_pubkey | String | Wallet service public key (hex) |
| encrypted_secret | Bytes | NWC secret encrypted at rest |
| relay_urls | String | JSON array of relay URLs for this wallet |
| status | Enum | `Connected`, `Disconnected`, `Connecting`, `Error` |
| wallet_name | String? | Human-readable wallet name (e.g., "Alby") |
| balance_sats | u64? | Optional cached balance |
| last_connected_at | Timestamp? | Last successful connection |
| created_at | Timestamp | When wallet was added |

**Validation rules**:
- `wallet_pubkey` MUST be a valid 64-char hex string.
- `relay_urls` MUST contain at least one valid wss:// URL.
- Only one active NWC wallet at a time.

---

### FileAttachment

An encrypted file sent or received in trade chat (#589). Stored inside its
`Message` (`AttachmentInfo`), read from v1's JSON message; nothing about the
key is stored — it is re-derived (raw ECDH with the counterpart) when needed.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| file_type | Enum | `Image`, `Document`, `Video` |
| mime_type | String | As declared by the sender (a label; the bytes are sniffed after decrypting) |
| file_name | String | Sanitized: last path component, no control characters |
| file_size | u64 | Size before encryption, in bytes (max 25MB) |
| blossom_url | String | `https://…/<sha256>` |
| sha256 | String | Hex SHA-256 of the encrypted blob, from the URL |
| encrypted_size | u64 | `file_size` + 28 (nonce + tag) |
| width / height | u32? | Pixel size, images only |
| download_status | Enum | `Pending`, `Downloading`, `Downloaded`, `Failed` |

The encrypted blob itself is cached in `attachment_blobs` (keyed by
`sha256`, still ciphertext, 300 MB cap, oldest evicted first,
wiped with the identity). On the web it is the IndexedDB store of the same
name, with an `attachment_blob_index` store of `{sha256, size, created_at}`
entries the eviction reads instead of the blobs; the cap there is 100 MB,
since the origin's quota is shared with the rest of the app's data.

**Validation rules**:
- `file_size` MUST not exceed 26,214,400 bytes (25MB).
- Only `https://` URLs naming a 64-hex blob hash are accepted; anything else
  keeps the message as text.
- Images auto-download; documents and videos are download-on-demand.

---

### Rating

A counterparty rating after a successful trade.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| trade_id | UUID | FK → Trade |
| rated_pubkey | String | Public key of the rated party |
| score | u8 | Rating score |
| submitted | bool | Whether rating was sent to daemon |
| created_at | Timestamp | When rating was created |

**Validation rules**:
- Only available when `identity.privacy_mode` is false.
- One rating per trade per direction (I rate them, they rate me).
