# Contract: Reputation API

**Module**: `rust/src/api/reputation.rs`

Rating system and privacy mode management.

## Functions

### submit_rating(trade_id: String, score: u8) → ()
Submit a rating for the counterparty after a successful trade.

**Preconditions**: Trade MUST be completed with `Success` outcome.
Identity MUST NOT be in privacy mode.

**Side effects**: Sends `rate` action to Mostro daemon via NIP-44 (Kind 14).

**Errors**: `TradeNotComplete`, `PrivacyModeEnabled`, `AlreadyRated`,
`ProtocolError`.

---

### get_privacy_mode() → bool
Check whether privacy mode is enabled.

---

### set_privacy_mode(enabled: bool) → ()
Enable or disable privacy mode.

**Side effects**: When enabled, no reputation data is sent/received
in future trades. Session recovery becomes unavailable.

**Errors**: none. The flag is stored whether an identity is loaded or not. The
launch-time restore runs right after the identity is loaded; the Account toggle
does not wait for one, since the app still opens when loading the identity fails.

---

### get_rating_for_trade(trade_id: String) → RatingInfo?
Get the rating submitted/received for a specific trade.
Returns null if no rating exists.

## Streams
