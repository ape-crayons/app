# Contract: Orders API

**Module**: `rust/src/api/orders.rs`

Order browsing, creation, and lifecycle management. Orders are fetched from
Mostro daemon via Kind 38383 Nostr events and cached locally.

### Daemon confirmation & request correlation

Every request that expects a daemon reply (`create_order`, `take_order`,
`send_invoice`, and `open_dispute` from the [disputes](disputes.md) API)
carries a random u64 `request_id` nonce. The daemon echoes
it in its reply (success or `CantDo`), and **only a reply echoing the exact
nonce may resolve or consume the pending request** — stale events replayed
by relays carry a different (or no) `request_id` and touch nothing. Each
call waits up to 10 s; on timeout it returns `NoDaemonResponse` and nothing
is persisted.

Before that wait, the request has to be accepted by a relay. Publishing
resolves on the first relay that answers `OK true`; when none does (every
relay refused the event, timed out or was not connected), the call fails with
`NoRelayAccepted` instead, rolls its pending record back and does not wait for
the daemon. A relay that timed out may still have stored and forwarded the
event, so the daemon can see the request anyway. The two are different
failures and the UI tells them apart: `NoDaemonResponse` means the request went out and no
reply came back, `NoRelayAccepted` points the user at their relay list.

What happens to a genuine reply that arrives **after** that timeout depends on
the request. The pending record survives the timeout in every case — only its
waiter detaches — so the late reply is still recognized as ours rather than as
a stale replay:

- **create**: reconciled — the daemon UUID is bound to the attempt's trade
  index, and the maker row is persisted from the echoed order itself (#394;
  the payload is the published order, min/max included).
- **take**: the nonce-correlated late reply itself is consumed by the waiter
  interception and dropped whole — it never reaches the per-action arms. The
  row it failed to establish is rebuilt by the NEXT daemon message carrying an
  order, or by the next start's replay, where no in-memory record remains to
  intercept (#394: role from the payload's trade pubkeys, or
  AddInvoice ⇒ buyer / PayInvoice ⇒ seller where mostrod omits them; never
  guessed).
- **add-invoice**: acknowledged and passed through — the reply doubles as a
  status update, which the per-action arms process as usual.
- **dispute**: reconciled — `record_late_acceptance` persists the accepted
  dispute under the daemon-assigned id (unread, and without the reason, which
  went with the timed-out call). So a `NoDaemonResponse` from `open_dispute` is
  **not** proof that no dispute can appear for that trade later. Retrying after
  the timeout does not break this: the retry takes the trade key over but
  carries every superseded attempt's nonce forward, so a reply to any of them
  is still correlated. See [disputes.md](disputes.md) for the full behavior.

## Functions

### get_orders(filters: OrderFilters?) → Vec<OrderInfo>
Fetch available orders. Returns cached orders if offline, live orders
if connected. Merges local cache with relay data.

**Parameters**:
```text
OrderFilters {
  kind: OrderKind?          # Buy or Sell
  fiat_code: String?        # ISO 4217 filter
  payment_method: String?   # Payment method filter
}
```

**Returns**: List of orders sorted by creation time (newest first).

---

### get_order(order_id: String) → OrderInfo?
Get single order details by ID. Returns from local cache or fetches
from relay.

---

### create_order(params: NewOrderParams) → OrderInfo
Publish a new order to the Mostro network.

**Parameters**:
```text
NewOrderParams {
  kind: OrderKind             # Buy or Sell
  fiat_amount: f64?           # Fixed amount in fiat (null if range)
  fiat_amount_min: f64?       # Min amount for range orders (null if fixed)
  fiat_amount_max: f64?       # Max amount for range orders (null if fixed)
  fiat_code: String           # ISO 4217 code
  payment_method: String      # Payment method description
  premium: f64                # Price premium/discount %
  amount_sats: u64?           # Optional fixed sat amount
}
```

**Validation**:
- Either `fiat_amount` OR both `fiat_amount_min` and `fiat_amount_max` MUST be provided (not both)
- If range: `fiat_amount_min` MUST be > 0 and < `fiat_amount_max`
- If range: `amount_sats` MUST be absent (not even `0`) — a range is priced at
  market when taken, and mostro-core refuses one with sats. Fails with
  `RangeOrderWithSats`.
- `fiat_code` MUST be valid ISO 4217
- `payment_method` MUST not be empty
- The amount is checked against the node's advertised `min_order_amount` /
  `max_order_amount` before anything is sent: directly for a fixed
  `amount_sats` (#282), and for a market-price order by converting every fiat
  amount the daemon will price — both ends of a range order — at the rate the
  node publishes (`fetch_exchange_rate` in `nostr.md`), truncating as the
  daemon does (#337). The fiat amount is first normalised to the whole unit the
  wire carries (`new_order` casts it to `i64`), so the check judges the amount
  the daemon actually receives rather than the decimal the user typed

**Fail-open**: that range check blocks nothing it cannot judge — no rate, no
advertised bounds, an amount that is not yet a finite positive number. The
order is submitted and the daemon stays the authority, answering
`OutOfRangeSatsAmount` if it disagrees. Blocking instead would make
market-price orders unusable against every node that leaves rate publishing
off, which the protocol allows.

**Side effects**: Sends the new-order message to the Mostro daemon and waits for its confirmation. The order is created only once the daemon confirms it; the public order book is populated exclusively from the daemon's Kind 38383 event (the order is **not** inserted optimistically). On no confirmation within the timeout the order is treated as not created — nothing is persisted to My Trades and nothing is added to the book.

**Book ownership on a fresh create (#552).** The order's Kind 38383 usually
outruns the confirmation that binds the daemon UUID and persists the maker
row, so the ingest writes the entry with `is_mine = false` — and the live
stream never redelivers the event to correct it. Persisting a maker row
(`persist_trade_row`, the funnel every row creation passes through) therefore
**claims** the order in the book, in memory and before the save: the claim
marks the order's existing entry `is_mine = true` and every later write of it,
whichever arrives first and even when the save fails. It never inserts an
entry, keeping the book fed by Kind 38383 alone. The ingest reads the claim
too, so it treats a claimed order as ours without a readable row. A taker's
row (`is_mine = false`) claims nothing.

Claims belong to the identity: forgetting the identity (#533) empties them
under the same lock, so a persist of the old identity's that was already
under way when the teardown began cannot mark the book afterwards. A node
switch keeps them (order ids are daemon UUIDs).

The ingest classifies an order for the identity current when it starts —
`is_mine` from the claim or the trade row, a refused wire status replaced
by the trade's, whether the order is ours — and awaits the database before
writing the entry. Forgetting the identity also bumps an ownership epoch,
which the ingest reads with the claim and the write checks again under the
book's lock: a classification made for a forgotten identity is discarded,
and the event applies as a stranger's order (its wire view, marked only by
a claim of the new identity's, dropped when finished).

Not covered: a persist that *starts* after the teardown, and writes that
read an entry and write it back outside the lock — no operation carries an
identity generation from where it began.

**Errors**: `NoIdentity`, `Offline` (queued), `NoDaemonResponse` (daemon did not confirm within the timeout), `ProtocolError`, `RangeOrderWithSats` (a range with `amount_sats`).

**Anti-abuse bond (maker).** A node that requires a maker bond answers the
create with `pay-bond-invoice` instead of `new-order`. The order then has its
daemon id but no kind 38383 event until the bond is paid: `create_order`
returns it at `WaitingMakerBond`, and persists the maker row with `bond` set
(`role = Maker`, `state = Requested`, the bolt11 and its decoded expiry). The
later `new-order` for that id is the only sign the bond locked; it moves the
row to `Pending` with the bond `Locked`. Walking away is `cancel_order`, which
in this window waits for the daemon's answer (see *Maker's bond window* under
`cancel_order`).

---

### take_order(order_id: String, role: TradeRole, fiat_amount: f64?) → TradeInfo
Take an existing order, starting a trade. `fiat_amount` is required for
range orders and must fall within `[fiat_amount_min, fiat_amount_max]`.

**Validation**:
- Order MUST exist in the book, not be own (`CannotTakeOwnOrder`) and be
  `Pending` (`OrderAlreadyTaken`)
- `role` MUST match the order kind (buyers take sell orders, sellers take
  buy orders)

**Side effects**: Sends TakeBuy/TakeSell (NIP-44 kind 14, with the
correlation nonce) and waits for the daemon's first reply, which varies by
role and daemon config — `add-invoice` (buyer: calculated sats in an Order
payload), `pay-invoice` (seller: hold invoice in a PaymentRequest payload),
or a direct progression message. Only on a correlated reply is the trade
created: the TradeInfo is built from the reply's real data (status,
calculated `amount_sats`, `hold_invoice`), persisted to My Trades, the
order book entry is synced, and the trade session/subscriptions start.
The row is the order's **only** trade row: every earlier row for the same
order id is deleted before the save. Rows are keyed by a fresh id per take
and lookups by order id are unordered (`LIMIT 1`), so a row an earlier take
left behind — its `Canceled` never reached this client, or it predates the
wipe on a taker's own cancel — would otherwise feed its status to the guards
that gate the new trade's messages, and its `trade_key_index` to the chat
session rebuild.
A confirmed take **installs** that session. A session may already exist for
two unrelated reasons, told apart by its `trade_key_index`: an earlier
confirmed take of the same order whose session was never removed (its
`Canceled` never reached this client) left a stale one (different index —
replaced, since each take derives a fresh trade key and keeping the earlier
session would leave chat key lookups reading a superseded index, #335), or
the peer reveal already created this take's own session with `peer_pubkey`
and `shared_key` set (same index — kept, since replacing it would drop the
chat keys that path exists to establish, #334).
That persistence half runs under the per-order lock (see *Per-order
serialization*), acquired after the reply and never around the wait for it.
On rejection or timeout **nothing is persisted** — no phantom trade, and no
session: a take that fails never leaves one behind.

The row is created with an **empty `counterparty_pubkey`**: a book
order's `creator_pubkey` is the Mostro node (the 38383 event author),
never the peer, and seeding it there poisons the durable peer record
(#334). The real peer arrives via the peer-reveal capture (see *Inbound
Kind 14 actions*), which may already have run on the take's first reply —
in that case the session **pre-exists** with peer and shared key set,
`install_session` keeps it (same index), and,
because the reveal ran before the row existed, its durable write was a
no-op: the persistence block replays it from the session and mirrors the
peer onto the returned `TradeInfo` (the field the UI gates the chat room
on). The durable half applies to backends with a trades store — on web
(#233) the write is a stub and only the session and the returned struct
carry the peer.

**Anti-abuse bond (taker).** A node that requires a taker bond answers the
take with `pay-bond-invoice`. That is an acceptance, not an error:
`take_order` returns the trade at `WaitingTakerBond` with `bond` set
(`role = Taker`, `state = Requested`), and the bond's amount never seeds
`order.amount_sats`. Publicly the order stays `pending` and takeable by
others until a bond locks; the first trade-flow message after the request
marks the bond `Locked`. A `canceled` in this window is a lost race or a
cancel, never a trade outcome, and wipes the row
(`docs/ANTI_ABUSE_BOND.md` §6.1).

**Errors**: `OrderNotFound`, `CannotTakeOwnOrder`, `OrderAlreadyTaken`,
`InvalidRole`, `FiatAmountRequired`/`OutOfRange` (range orders),
`NoDaemonResponse`, plus daemon `CantDo` reasons passed through as errors.

**How a `CantDo` reason reaches the caller** (`cant_do_message` in
`rust/src/api/orders.rs`, shared by every daemon-bound call: take, create,
cancel, add-invoice, dispute…). `MaintenanceMode` and `InvalidTradeIndex` arrive
as the bare marker. A reason without its own arm arrives as `CantDo:<Reason>`
(`CantDo:InvalidOrderStatus`), never as prose naming the enum (#719). The
reasons that still carry English prose (`OutOfRange*`, `InvalidAmount`,
`InvalidInvoice`, `IsNotYourOrder`, `NotAllowedByStatus`,
`OrderAlreadyCanceled`) keep it until #373 turns them into markers. Dart
matches a reason by substring, so `CantDo:<Reason>` and the bare reason both
match; a screen never shows the raw text as its fallback.

---

### cancel_order(order_id: String) → ()
Send the daemon a `Cancel` for the order, signed with its trade key (the
persisted `trade_keys` binding). The same call serves a maker's own pending
order, a take that has not gone active yet, and an active trade — where
mostrod runs its cooperative-cancel state machine. The daemon decides; this
function does not validate ownership or status.

**Local side effects**, applied once the message is published:
- The order leaves the in-memory book.
- A trade row that never went active (`Pending` / `WaitingBuyerInvoice` /
  `WaitingPayment`), maker's or taker's, is **left untouched**: the daemon's
  `Canceled` — or the Kind 38383 `canceled` it publishes when the order dies
  with the cancel, whichever lands first — wipes it with its session (see
  *Daemon cancellation semantics*), the path a waiting timeout takes too.
  The cancelled trade leaves My Trades, as in v1. Marking it `Canceled`
  first made that arm skip the row as already canceled, so the row and the
  session outlived the trade, and the row's terminal status then refused the
  daemon's `pending` republish — the ex-taker never saw the order in the book
  again. No reference client writes anything before the daemon replies. A
  cancel the daemon refuses also leaves a live trade looking live.
- A row further along keeps its status and records
  `cooperative_cancel_state = RequestedByMe`: from `active` on the cancel is
  a request the counterparty must agree to (protocol `cancel.md`, "Cancel
  cooperatively"), and the daemon's `cooperative-cancel-initiated-by-you`
  confirms it. It used to be marked `Canceled` at once; that showed a
  cancelled trade the daemon still ran, and the terminal status then made
  the daemon's `cooperative-cancel-accepted` look like a replay over a
  finished trade and dropped it, so the requester never learned the
  counterparty had agreed. An `in-progress` row may still be a never-active
  take; the daemon's `Canceled` then settles it as before.

**Between the request and the daemon's answer.** The call returns once the
message is published; nothing waits for the daemon.
- A never-active trade: the screen the user cancelled from goes home at
  once. The trade screen and the invoice screens say the cancel request was
  sent; the maker's own order screen says the order was cancelled. My Trades
  keeps listing the trade at its previous status until the daemon's
  `Canceled` or the public `canceled` wipes it, normally within a second or
  two.
- No answer (relay down, app closed before it lands): a taker's
  `WaitingBuyerInvoice` / `WaitingPayment` row is settled by the stale sweep
  (*Stale-state sweep*). The sweep runs 60 s after the order subscription
  starts and then every 30 minutes, and acts once the row is past its window
  (`timeout_at`, else `started_at` + 900 s), asking the relays for the
  order's public status. A maker's `Pending` row is left to the public
  `canceled`: the sweep does not look at pending rows, so if that event is
  missed too, the row stays listed as pending.
- Refused (`CantDo`): nothing changes locally, which is right, because the
  trade is still live. But the user is not told: `cancel_order` does not wait
  for the reply, and the `CantDo` arm finds no pending request to route it to.
- A trade further along stays as it was, with the request noted on the row
  (above); the trade screen says the cancel waits for the counterparty and
  drops the `Cancel` action until the daemon settles the trade.

**Maker's bond window** (`WaitingMakerBond`, docs/ANTI_ABUSE_BOND.md §6.2).
Here the call **does** wait: the cancel carries a `request_id`, and the daemon's
answer decides the outcome, within 10 s.
- `canceled` (mostro#996): the daemon closed the unpublished order and cancelled
  the bond invoice. The row is wiped with `Canceled` / `UserCanceled` before the
  call returns.
- `NotAllowedByStatus`: the bond locked first, or the daemon predates #996. The
  call watches the row for 5 s, then checks the public book under the order's
  guard. If the row moved to `Pending`, or the book carries the order, the order
  is live: the row is reconciled to the lock, and the call fails with
  `BondAlreadyLocked`. With no evidence either way nothing is wiped: the call
  fails with `MakerCancelRefused`, and the user may drop the order from this
  device with `abandon_bonded_order` (see `contracts/bond.md`).
- Any other `CantDo`: the call fails with the daemon's reason, in the form
  described under `take_order` ("How a `CantDo` reason reaches the caller").
- No answer: `NoDaemonResponse`, and the row stays. A late `canceled` still wipes
  it as the user's own cancel, including one answering an earlier attempt that a
  retry superseded.

A `canceled` with no cancel of this client behind it is the daemon's payment
deadline (mostro#994): the row is wiped with `Canceled` / `BondExpired`.

**Errors**: no trade-key binding for the order (`no persisted trade key for
order …`), trade-key or identity load failures, and publish failures. Daemon
rejections arrive later as `CantDo`; this call does not wait for them, except in
the maker's bond window (`BondAlreadyLocked`, `MakerCancelRefused`,
`NoDaemonResponse`, the `CantDo` reason).

---

### send_invoice(order_id: String, invoice_or_address: String, amount_sats: u64) → ()
For sell orders: buyer submits a bolt11 invoice or a Lightning Address for
receiving payment. For LN addresses (`user@domain`) `amount_sats` is
required so the daemon can resolve the address; bolt11 invoices encode
their own amount.

**Side effects**: Sends `AddInvoice` (with the correlation nonce) and waits
for the daemon's acknowledgement — its reply (`waiting-seller-to-pay`,
`buyer-invoice-accepted`, …) is also a status update and is processed
normally. The UI advances on acknowledgement **or** when the trade's status
moves past the invoice step (`active`, `fiat-sent`, `dispute`, `success`),
whichever comes first: the acknowledgement is awaited for 10 s only, and the
daemon's reply queue can outlast that, so an accepted invoice may read as
`NoDaemonResponse`. The invoice screen therefore follows the trade status
rather than trusting the call's outcome alone.

**Errors**: `InvalidInvoice` (daemon CantDo), `NoDaemonResponse` (stay on
the invoice step — the submission may still have been accepted),
`NotAllowedByStatus` (daemon CantDo: the order no longer waits for an invoice,
i.e. client and daemon diverged; the screen runs `resync()` to recover the
missed message and leaves once the status catches up), `TradeNotFound`.

---

### confirm_fiat_received(trade_id: String) → ()
Seller confirms fiat payment received. Triggers fund release.

**Side effects**: Sends `Release` action to Mostro daemon.

**Errors**: `TradeNotFound`, `NotSeller`, `WrongTradeState`.

---

### mark_fiat_sent(trade_id: String) → ()
Buyer marks fiat payment as sent.

**Side effects**: Sends `FiatSent` action to Mostro daemon.

**Errors**: `TradeNotFound`, `NotBuyer`, `WrongTradeState`.

---

### request_cooperative_cancel(trade_id: String) → ()
Request cooperative cancellation of active trade.

**Side effects**: Sends cooperative cancel request to Mostro daemon.
Counterparty receives notification.

**Errors**: `TradeNotFound`, `WrongTradeState`, `ProtocolError`.

---

### accept_cooperative_cancel(trade_id: String) → ()
Accept a cooperative cancel request from the counterparty.

**Side effects**: Sends acceptance to Mostro daemon. Trade is canceled
and escrowed funds returned.

**Errors**: `TradeNotFound`, `NoPendingCancelRequest`, `ProtocolError`.

---

### get_active_trade() → TradeInfo?
Get the current active trade. Returns null if no trade is active.

---

### get_trade_history() → Vec<TradeHistoryEntry>
Get completed trades ordered by completion time (newest first).

---

### share_order(order_id: String) → OrderShareInfo
Generate a shareable deep link and QR data for an order.

**Returns**:
```text
OrderShareInfo {
  deep_link: String     # mostro://order/<id>
  qr_data: String       # Data to encode in QR code
  order: OrderInfo
}
```

---

### resolve_deep_link(uri: String) → String?
Parse a `mostro://order/<id>` deep link and return the order ID.
Returns null if URI is not a valid Mostro deep link.

## Streams

### on_orders_updated() → Stream<Vec<OrderInfo>>
Emits whenever the order list changes (new orders, status updates,
expirations). Used to keep the UI order list in sync.

### on_trade_updated() → Stream<TradeUpdate>
`occurred_at` is Unix seconds from the source daemon event, including
recovery, republish, and peer-reputation refresh emissions. Locally initiated
changes use the local clock. Notification consumers use this timestamp for
presentation and the identity-import history cutoff; replay must never reset it.

Push channel for daemon-driven trade lifecycle changes. Every status a
Kind 14 dispatch arm syncs is emitted here after the in-memory book
update and the DB persistence **attempt** — a DB write failure (or a
memory-only session, where `db()` is `None`) is logged and does not
suppress the notification, so listeners must not assume the trade row
already reflects the status. Also emitted by the stale-state sweep's
maker resync. Two consumer needs:
changes the 2s status polling cannot observe (a never-active trade is
**wiped** from the DB on the daemon's `Canceled` — no row left to poll —
and after a taker-timeout republish the book reads `pending` again), and
action requests the user must react to promptly — `WaitingBuyerInvoice` /
`WaitingPayment` drive the app-wide auto-navigation to the add-invoice /
pay-invoice screens (`TradeActionListener`, which resolves the trade role
so the counterparty's informational copy of those statuses never
navigates). Take replies produce no emission: the take waiter consumes
them before the dispatch arms run. Screens filter by `order_id`.

```text
TradeUpdate {
  order_id: String
  status: OrderStatus   # the status just persisted; Pending on maker resync
  reason: TradeUpdateReason?  # optional cause for local/cancellation transitions
  occurred_at: i64      # Unix seconds: daemon event time, or local action time
}

TradeUpdateReason: UserCanceled | MakerCanceled | BondLostRace | BondExpired
                 | CooperativeCancelRequestedByMe | CooperativeCancelRequestedByPeer
```

The two `CooperativeCancelRequested*` reasons ride on an emission whose
`status` did **not** change (it is the row's current `Active` / `FiatSent`):
they say a cooperative-cancel request was confirmed for this side or made
by the counterparty. Consumers keyed on status alone (the trade screen's
status provider) see nothing new; the Notifications cards key on status
**and** reason, so each request gets its own card, once.

### on_order_status_changed(order_id: String) → Stream<OrderStatus>
Emits when a specific order's status changes.

### on_trade_step_changed() → Stream<TradeInfo>
Emits when the active trade's step changes. Used to update the
trade progress stepper.

### on_cooperative_cancel_requested() → Stream<String>
Emits when the counterparty requests a cooperative cancel.
Payload is the trade ID.

### on_trade_timeout_tick() → Stream<TradeTimeoutInfo>
Emits countdown updates for time-limited trade states.

```text
TradeTimeoutInfo {
  trade_id: String
  seconds_remaining: u32
  state: TradeStep
}
```

## Seller hold-invoice flow (Nostr → DB → UI)

The seller never receives the bolt11 hold invoice via a synchronous API
call — it arrives as a Kind 14 (NIP-44) message from mostrod. This
section documents the full chain so Flutter providers and screens know
what to listen to. Reference: <https://mostro.network/protocol/seller_pay_hold_invoice.html>.

### Kind-14 delivery & decryption coverage

Receiving a daemon Kind 14 takes two independent layers, and BOTH must
cover the trade or its messages are lost (dropped as
`no-matching-p-tag`, observable in the logs with the map size):

- **Delivery** — the bulk `mostro-dm` relay subscription, author-pinned to
  the active node, whose `#p` filter must include the trade key's pubkey.
- **Decryption** — the refreshable coverage map (`global_dm_keys`,
  pubkey → keys+index) the event loop decrypts against.

Coverage invariants:

- **Both subscription entry points seed in full.** Startup
  (`_run_order_subscription`) and node switch derive every known trade key
  (indexes `1..=identity.trade_key_index`) and seed the map through the
  shared `seed_global_dm_coverage()` before subscribing. A session that
  does not rehydrate leaves every previous session's trade deaf: statuses
  freeze at whatever the public Kind 38383 shows (masked `in-progress`),
  requests like add-invoice never reach the user, and the daemon
  eventually cancels by timeout (#277 cause 3).
- **Seeding is a union, never a replace** — a key derived concurrently by
  a create/take in flight must survive the seed.
- **Mid-session keys join incrementally**: every derive path calls
  `ensure_global_dm_coverage`, which inserts the key and re-issues the
  relay filter under the same stable subscription id — closing that id
  first, since nostr-sdk 0.45 rejects a duplicate id and keeps the stale
  filter (`replace_subscription`). Every re-issue — this one and a node
  switch's — goes through `replace_global_dm_filter`, which reads the map and
  replaces the filter under one lock: interleaved CLOSE/REQ pairs would
  otherwise keep an older key set or fail with a duplicate id.
- **The relay filter is always rebuilt from the full map** — never from
  session-local state. A rebuild from a subset silently unsubscribes the
  missing trades at the relay.
- The temporary 30-minute per-trade receivers (see #182) are an
  additional delivery path, not a substitute: they exist only for trades
  touched this session and mask coverage gaps while they run.
- **The bulk filter is unbounded on purpose** — no `since`, no `limit`, so
  after any downtime it replays the node's full stored history instead of a
  window, and nothing is lost to a cutoff derived from an unreliable local
  clock. The cost is that relays serve that backlog **newest-first**;
  ordering is settled downstream, by the per-order `status_cursor:`
  high-water mark described under the status-sync rules, not by narrowing
  the filter. Only the ephemeral per-trade subscription carries a cutoff
  (`limit(0)`, live-only).

### Per-trade watcher lifecycle (single owner, #325)

The 30-minute per-trade receiver has, per trade key, exactly one owner,
enforced by a registry in `nostr/subscriptions.rs`:

- **One owner per trade key.** `subscribe_daemon_messages` claims the key
  before any setup; a claim finding a live owner bounces — the relay-side
  REQ and the pending-request record stay untouched — so re-arming a
  covered key (the restore apply #218, the resume paths #291/#308) is
  idempotent.
- **A bounce is never backed by setup alone.** A claim advances
  `Setup → Live` only once at least one relay accepted the REQ — the SDK
  reports a subscribe every relay rejected as an `Ok`, and a rejected REQ
  is dropped from the relay's registry, beyond reconnect resubscription's
  reach, so it counts as a failed setup and releases the claim. A claim
  landing mid-setup parks until the owner is Live (then bounces, against
  a real REQ) or until that setup fails and releases (then takes over and
  subscribes itself). A bounce is therefore always a promise of coverage
  that exists.
- **A bounce is a lease refresh**: it re-arms the owner's 30-minute idle
  window, so the promised coverage lasts a full window from the bounce,
  not whatever remained of the old one.
- **Teardown is targeted and atomic.** The idle-timeout exit consults the
  registry under its lock: re-armed → reset the timer and keep running;
  otherwise unsubscribe that one trade's REQ and purge its pending record
  while still holding the lock, so no concurrent claim can land between
  the decision and the destruction. The purge spares a record whose
  waiter is still attached: its caller registered it before claiming
  (the create/take ordering) and may be parked on the registry, about to
  subscribe from scratch — only a detached record (its 10 s timeout ran)
  is dead state. Shutdown/closed-channel exits tear
  down unconditionally — their receiver is dead — and post-reconnect
  coverage belongs to the re-arm paths, not to the registry.
- **An abandoned setup cannot wedge a key.** The claim is an RAII guard:
  a setup that ends in neither mark-live nor release (a panic unwinding
  it, a cancelled future) frees the claim on drop, so parked claims take
  over instead of hanging every later take/create on that key.

### Inbound Kind 14 actions consumed by `dispatch_mostro_message`

**Peer-reveal capture (#334), before the per-action arms.** Any message —
whatever its action — whose payload carries a `SmallOrder` naming **both**
trade pubkeys (an `Order` payload or a `PaymentRequest`) reveals the
counterparty: our trade key is matched against the two and the other side
is taken, symmetrically, with no per-action role table. The peer is then
persisted to the trade row (`update_trade_counterparty` — the row is the
durable peer record, the session a cache of it; on web the write is a
stub, #233, and the session is the only holder) and the session is
updated **or created**: no session is the maker's *normal* case, since
`take_order` is the only other session creator. Ordering is load-bearing:
the capture runs after the generation gate and the local→daemon UUID
reconciliation (it writes by the daemon's order id) but **before the
take-waiter interception**, so a take's first reply — consumed there and
never seen by the arms — still reveals. `BondSlashed` is exempt for the
same reason it skips the generation gate: it may address a superseded
generation and must not write order state. Empty or unparsable pubkeys do
not qualify, the terminal-status guard applies (a stale replay over a
finished trade must not respawn chat state), and an already-complete
capture (session holds peer + shared key) short-circuits — the capture
runs for every replayed message on each restart, and that replay is also
what rebuilds sessions after one.

Keyed by the message's order id (`trade_index` is `None`). The follow-up `AddInvoice` with a `Payload::Peer` (counterparty reputation) is ignored. A payload status of `settled-hold-invoice` is the payout-failure replacement request (mostrod `check_failure_retries`, retries exhausted) and also maps to `WaitingBuyerInvoice` — persisting the settled status would hide the request and strand the payout. |

| `CooperativeCancelInitiatedByYou` / `CooperativeCancelInitiatedByPeer` | (none)     | No status change (the protocol has no cancel-requested status): `cooperative_cancel_state → RequestedByMe` / `RequestedByPeer` on the row, and a `TradeUpdate` with the row's **current** status (`Active` or `FiatSent`) and reason `CooperativeCancelRequestedByMe` / `CooperativeCancelRequestedByPeer`, so the trade screen and the Notifications cards announce the request. Gated like a status sync (terminal row, cursor). |

| `PayBondInvoice`                   | `Payload::PaymentRequest(small_order, bolt11, _)`   | A bond bolt11 no take or create is waiting for (the daemon's idempotent re-send, a replay): refreshes `bond.invoice` and its expiry on an existing bond-window row, never creates one |
| `BondSlashed`                      | `Payload::Order(small_order)`                       | Informational: the payload amount is the **slashed bond**, never written to the order. Marks `bond.state → Slashed` when the row still exists (winning over a provisional `Released`), infers the cause from the row's status, emits `on_bond_slashed`. Exempt from the generation gate |
| `AddBondInvoice`                   | `Payload::BondPayoutRequest { order, slashed_at }`  | No trade row involved: upserts a payout claim for (`sender`, order) per the §6.4 table (`contracts/bond.md`). Our own `PaymentRequest` echo is ignored |
| `BondInvoiceAccepted` / `BondPayoutCompleted` | (none)                                   | Claim phase → `Acknowledged` / `Completed` for the sending node's claim; no trade row involved |

Two rules gate every status sync in the table, and both exist for the
same reason: the global kind-14 subscription carries no `since`, so every
start replays the node's whole history for an order, and relays serve
stored events **newest-first**. A skipped sync is skipped entirely — no
book write, no DB write, no `TradeUpdate`, and no session side effect
either (both guards run before the peer-key/chat setup of the
escrow-locked arm).

**Ordering.** Each order carries a persisted high-water mark,
`status_cursor:<order_id>` — the `created_at` of the newest daemon
message whose status write was applied, stored **raw, in the node's time
domain**, which is the domain the comparison uses. It is deliberately not
clamped to the local clock the way the chat cursor is: there the value is
a subscription `since`, where a low one only asks for more than needed,
while here it is an ordering comparator, and a local clock behind the
node's would make a newest event store a smaller mark that the next older
one then outranks. The mark is instead not advanced at all by an event
dated beyond the clock-skew tolerance, so one malformed timestamp cannot
silence an order for good; a node genuinely further ahead makes the rule
inert for that order rather than wrong, and says so in the log. Ordering
between the node's own events survives any uniform skew — they share one
clock. A message **strictly older** than the mark is skipped. Strictly older: the daemon emits several messages for one
order inside the same second (the `PayInvoice` reputation follow-up, for
one) and those are genuine in-order traffic. Without this rule the oldest
message of the backlog is applied last and wins — a disputed trade came
back as `waiting-buyer-invoice` on the next start, with every state in
between emitted to the UI on the way down.

The mark is deliberately **not** cleared with the trade row: a `Canceled`
before the trade went active wipes that row, which is exactly where the
terminal rule below goes blind, and the mark is what still refuses the
replay afterwards. One settings row per order ever traded, the same shape
and lifetime as the `chat_cursor:` that bounds the other channel.

**Terminal status.** A sync that would move a trade out of a
**hard-terminal** status (`Canceled` / `CanceledByAdmin` /
`CooperativelyCanceled` / `Expired` / `Success` / `SettledByAdmin` /
`CompletedByAdmin`) is skipped: mostrod never reopens a finished trade,
so such a message is an out-of-order replay whatever its timestamp says.
This is not redundant with the ordering rule — it reads the in-memory
book, so it is the only one of the two that still holds where there is no
durable store (web, #233). `Canceled` applies it too: a stale
timeout-cancel replayed over an order that was later re-taken and
completed must not overwrite the outcome; its wipe path is unaffected,
since it starts from non-terminal waiting states.

`SettledHoldInvoice` and `Dispute` are deliberately **not** in the
terminal set — they still progress, to `Success` and to admin
resolutions respectively — so it is the ordering rule, not this one, that
keeps a replay from walking them backwards.

Every arm above that syncs a status also emits a `TradeUpdate` (see
`on_trade_updated`) after the in-memory book update and the DB
persistence attempt — DB failures are logged, never suppress the
emission, and leave the row behind the book. `Canceled` included, which
emits whether it wiped the row or kept it as history.

### Per-order serialization

`dispatch_mostro_message` and `take_order`'s persistence block both check
local state and mutate the order book, the trade row and the session
several `await`s later. Those two halves are **one operation per
`order_id`**, held under a per-order mutex (#259).

Without it, a delivery that passed its check can be overtaken by a retake
of the same order while it is suspended: the retake persists its own
state, then the suspended handler resumes and writes the previous
generation's outcome over it. The `Canceled` arm is the reachable case —
it has mutated book and DB with no generation check of its own.

Invariants:

- **The lock is keyed by `order_id`, never global.** One stalled handler
  must not stop every other trade.
- **`dispatch_mostro_message` takes it once the message kind is parsed**,
  covering the local→daemon id reconcile, the waiter interception and
  every per-action arm. A message carrying no order id owns no order state
  and takes no lock.
- **No caller may hold it while waiting for a daemon reply.** That reply is
  delivered by `dispatch_mostro_message`, which takes the same lock, so
  `take_order` acquires it only *after* its wait resolves — around the
  persistence block alone. Holding it across the wait deadlocks the take
  until its 10 s timeout.
- **The take reply hands the guard off.** The dispatcher that resolves a
  waiting `take_order` sends its own guard through the waiter channel
  (`Wake.order_guard`), so consumed-reply → persistence is one critical
  section: released instead, a second daemon message already queued on the
  FIFO mutex would beat the woken task and run its arm against a trade row
  and session that do not exist yet. The guard rides *inside* the channel
  value, so every losing path releases it by dropping — a timed-out
  waiter's failed send, a receiver dropped with the reply unread. Only the
  take reply carries a guard: an add-invoice's effects are persisted by
  the dispatch arms themselves (still holding it), and a create's gap is
  owned by the reconcile block and the late-confirmation persistence
  (#394 — the Kind 38383 feed is the order book only, never a source of
  ownership or keys).
- **The registry tracks live work, not history**: entries no handler holds
  any more are dropped on the next acquisition, so it does not grow with
  every order ever dispatched.
- **A generation gate backs the lock**, read under it so it cannot
  interleave with a retake's rebind: a message addressed to a trade key
  *older* than the one currently bound to its order (`trade_keys` binding)
  belongs to a superseded attempt and is dropped whole — the lock
  serializes concurrent handlers, the gate rejects the late ones.
  Strictly-older only: a retake's first reply arrives on the NEW key while
  the binding still holds the old index (`take_order` rebinds only after
  that reply resolves its waiter), and the identity counter only grows, so
  newer-than-bound is always legitimate. No binding fails open (a create's
  confirmation precedes any binding for the daemon id). The gate compares
  against the persisted `trade_keys` binding — written by `take_order` on
  every confirmed take (`store_trade_key_index`) — not against
  `Session.trade_key_index`, which a retake could leave stale until #335.
  That is why a superseded reply was already dropped even while the session
  held the previous take's index. `BondSlashed` is
  exempt: it never writes order state, and a trailing slash notice
  addressed to the slashed (superseded) generation is by-design delivery
  (#197).

### Daemon cancellation semantics

- A trade still in `Pending` / `WaitingBuyerInvoice` / `WaitingPayment` when
  the daemon's `Canceled` arrives never went active — no peer, no chat, no
  exchange (typically a waiting-state timeout). Its trade row and in-memory
  session are **deleted**, mirroring v1's session cleanup; chat messages are
  untouched (none can exist before Active). Trades that progressed keep
  their row (and chat) as history, marked `Canceled`. `InProgress` rows are
  conservatively kept: that status only enters via the Kind 38383 sync,
  where mostrod masks both waiting AND active phases as `in-progress`.
  This covers a taker's own cancel too: `cancel_order` leaves a never-active
  row for this arm rather than marking it `Canceled` first. When the row
  cannot be deleted, nothing else is touched — row, session and book entry
  keep describing the same trade.
- The **Kind 38383 `canceled`** wipes such a trade the same way, on both
  ingest paths (`wipe_on_public_cancel`). mostrod reports the end of a
  never-active trade twice — it publishes the event, then enqueues the
  `Canceled` (cancel.rs) — and the two reach separate subscriptions, so
  either may be handled first. Had the event written `Canceled` into the
  row, the `Canceled` arm would then keep it as history, and a maker's own
  cancel (or a take whose maker cancelled) would end in My Trades or out of
  it depending on arrival order. The event is also the only report of an
  expired pending order: mostrod publishes `Expired` as `canceled` and sends
  no message. The decision reads the trade row itself, never the book, so a
  stranger's `pending` order cannot pass for a never-active trade of ours;
  a trade further along keeps its row, marked `Canceled`. When the event
  wins, the `Canceled` that follows is dropped by the tombstone below.
- Every such wipe — the daemon's `Canceled`, the public `canceled` and the
  stale sweep — goes through `wipe_never_active_trade` → `wipe_trade_row`,
  which leaves a tombstone (`trade_wiped:<order_id>` =
  `<wiped_at>:<trade_key_index>`, #394). The order's replayed messages for
  that generation are then dropped whole, so on the next start neither the
  DM rebuild nor `adopt_range_remainder` brings the row back. A retake of the
  order is a later generation and lifts it (`persist_trade_row`).
- The handler MUST NOT blindly remove the order from the in-memory book: on
  a taker-responsible timeout mostrod republishes the order as `pending`
  BEFORE sending `Canceled`, so a blind remove races the republish and
  loses the order until restart. The book is fed only by Kind 38383 events;
  a genuine cancel arrives as a status update and the UI filters it out.
- A wiped **take** hands its order back to the public book. While the take
  stood, the entry carried the local trade status wherever the wire's was
  refused (see *Public status vs. trade status*) — so the `pending`
  republish, arriving first, was refused, and nothing arrives after the
  `Canceled` to correct it: the order vanished from the ex-taker's book alone.
  The book therefore notes the latest public view of each order the d-tag
  subscription watches (the book feed keeps an existing note current after
  that subscription idles out), and the wipe settles the entry from it:
  - latest view `pending` → the entry becomes that view, takeable again;
  - any other view, or none while the entry holds a non-`pending` local
    status → the entry is dropped, so the next Kind 38383 event lands on
    nothing local and applies as is (this covers a `Canceled` that overtook
    the republish);
  - no view and the entry already `pending` → left alone.

  Only that settle reads a note back, so a note is forgotten once nothing
  can: when the order's public view turns hard-terminal (after that event's
  own wipe decision, which settles from it), and when a daemon message ends
  the trade without a wipe. The notes tolerate a poisoned lock.

  A **maker's** own order dies with the cancel; its entry is left to the
  daemon's Kind 38383 `canceled`. Every reference client (mobile, mostrix,
  mostro-cli) builds its book from Kind 38383 alone, so an ex-taker there
  sees the republish without any of this.

### Stale-state sweep

Covers cancellations whose daemon message the app never received (closed or
offline when the daemon's waiting window expired). Runs 60s after the
order subscription starts, then every 30 minutes: waiting trades past
their window (`timeout_at`, else `started_at + 900`) are checked against
the public book — `pending` republish wipes taker rows (handing the order
back to the book, as the `Canceled` wipe does) and resyncs maker
rows to `Pending`; an outright cancel wipes; absence from the book or the
ambiguous `in-progress` marker changes nothing. Every action requires a
positive daemon signal; the clock only triggers the check. The sweep also
drops keyless in-memory sessions older than 24h and logs counters.

`process_gift_wrap_rumor` MUST update **both** the in-memory order book
(`order_book().update_order_status`) **and** the persisted trade row
(`db.update_trade_fields`) on every status transition, otherwise UI
screens reading from the DB (e.g. `tradeInfoStreamProvider`) will miss
transitions that only affected in-memory state.

### Public status vs. trade status

The `s` tag of a Kind 38383 event is NIP-69's four-bucket view of an order
(`pending`, `in-progress`, `success`, `canceled`), not its protocol status.
mostrod publishes `in-progress` when an order leaves the book and then stops
publishing altogether while the trade is private: `Active`, `FiatSent`,
`Dispute` and `SettledHoldInvoice` never reach the wire (`create_status_tags`
returns `create_event = false`, so no event is emitted at all). `WaitingTakerBond`
publishes as `pending`; `WaitingMakerBond` publishes nothing.

Therefore `OrderStatus::InProgress` on this client means **taken, real state
unknown** — never that the escrow is locked. The fine-grained states are only
ever learned from daemon messages, so:

- Both wire ingest paths (`ingest_order_event`, `subscribe_single_order`) MUST
  gate the status through `wire_status_applies`: a wire status may only fill an
  unknown or still-`Pending` local status, or announce a terminal one. It MUST
  NOT overwrite a status already learned from a daemon message, in the trade row
  or in the order book. The book entry carries that local status only while
  a trade of ours stands: once a never-active take is wiped, the entry goes
  back to the public view (see *Daemon cancellation semantics*). A
  `canceled` that reaches a never-active trade of ours wipes it instead of
  being written to it (same section).
- Both paths MUST accept only events authored by the active node: a d-tag is
  public, and a `canceled` deletes a trade row. The live book subscription
  and the refetch drop other authors before ingesting; `subscribe_single_order`
  reads the client's shared notification stream and checks the author itself.
  A node switch re-targets the long-lived subscriptions but leaves that task
  running on the previous node, so it also stops as soon as an event of its
  order arrives while its node is no longer the active one, as
  `dispatch_mostro_message` rejects any sender but the active node.
- One `subscribe_single_order` task per order. A retake calls it again while
  the first take's task may still be running; the newest call replaces the
  older task, which stops at its next wake without touching the
  `mostro-order-<id>` subscription. The new task re-opens it (a fresh idle
  window) and is the only one that may drop it.
- UI MUST NOT treat `InProgress` as `Active`. Actions the daemon gates on
  `Active`/`FiatSent` (dispute, fiat-sent) are rejected with `CantDo` in that
  state (issue #203).

### `update_trade_fields(order_id, status?, hold_invoice?, amount_sats?)` (DB contract)

SQLite native backend updates the `trades.data` JSON column atomically
via `json_set` layering. Constraints:

- Numeric parameters (`amount_sats`) MUST be wrapped via `json(?)` so
  SQLite parses them as JSON numbers. Binding a plain `sats.to_string()`
  through `?` stores the value as a JSON **string**, which breaks
  `serde_json::from_str::<TradeInfo>` on the next read and causes
  `list_trades()` to silently skip the row (see `sqlite.rs::list_trades`
  which logs a warn and continues). This is a permanent corruption of
  the row until a subsequent update rewrites the field.
- Enum parameters (`status`) follow the same rule — already implemented
  via `serde_json::to_string(&status)` + `json(?)`.
- String parameters (`hold_invoice`) are bound as raw text; SQLite's
  `json_set` auto-quotes and escapes them into a valid JSON string.
- The `WHERE` clause is `json_extract(data, '$.order.id') = ?`. An
  UPDATE matching zero rows is NOT an error; callers MUST ensure the
  trade row has been inserted via `save_trade` before the first update.

Web backend (`indexeddb.rs::update_trade_fields`) is currently a stub
and does not yet persist — feature-gated via `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]`.
It logs a `log::warn!` on every call so web builds fail loudly (not
silently) when seller pay-invoice flows hit this path; a full
read-modify-write port of the sqlite.rs logic using `indexed_db_futures`
is tracked as follow-up work.

### One-time migration: `amount_sats` string → integer repair

A previous version of `update_trade_fields` bound `amount_sats` as a raw
text parameter, so `json_set` stored it as a JSON **string** instead of
a JSON integer, silently corrupting the row for future deserialization.
`SqliteStorage::migrate` now runs a one-time repair on boot that walks
the `trades` table and rewrites any row where
`json_type(data, '$.order.amount_sats') = 'text'` to cast the value back
into a JSON integer via `CAST(... AS INTEGER)` inside `json_set`. The
migration logs the number of rows repaired (or 0 if none) so affected
installations self-heal on the next app start.

### Flutter-side live subscriptions (all platforms)

The seller pay-invoice flow uses two complementary providers from
`lib/features/order/providers/trade_state_provider.dart`:

- **`tradeInfoStreamProvider(orderId)`** — polls `listTrades()` every
  1 s, yields the full `TradeInfo`, and **terminates as soon as
  `holdInvoice != null`**. Used by `PayLightningInvoiceScreen` to
  resolve the bolt11 + amount for rendering the QR. Consumers that
  need post-invoice updates MUST compose this with
  `tradeStatusProvider`.
- **`tradeStatusProvider(orderId)`** — polls `getOrder()` every 2 s
  with a `listTrades()` fallback when the order has left the in-memory
  order book. Runs until the status is terminal. `PayLightningInvoiceScreen`
  subscribes via `ref.listen` and navigates to `/trade_detail/:orderId`
  on `Active` (or later non-cancel statuses), and away to `/home` on
  any cancellation/expiry. This is the single source of truth for
  advancing past the pay-invoice screen; the NWC widget's local
  `onPaymentSuccess` callback only flips a spinner flag and does not
  navigate.

`tradeStatusProvider` reads the order book first, and the book holds the
order's public view. So the My Trades list and `TradeDetailScreen` show a
trade through `shownTradeStatus`, where the trade row wins in two cases:

- **The row has ended** (success or a cancelled family): whatever the book
  says about the order afterwards is no longer this trade.
- **A take, and the book says `pending`**: a public `pending` means nobody
  holds the order, so it is never a take's status. That covers a take left
  `Canceled` by builds that wrote the status before the daemon answered
  (the daemon later put the order back in the book), and a take parked at
  `WaitingTakerBond`, whose order is still `pending` in public.

Every other live status wins over an open row.

The take screen sends a user who already takes part in the order to the
trade instead of offering to take it again (`tradeRoleLookupProvider`,
`participatingRole`). A take whose row has ended does not count: once its
order can be taken again, such a row can only be what a take that never
went active left behind, and `take_order` replaces it with the new take's
row. A maker's row always counts, and so does any row still open.
