# Contract: Identity API

**Module**: `rust/src/api/identity.rs`

Identity management — key generation, import, export, secure storage, and
BIP-32 trade key derivation (`m/44'/1237'/38383'/0/N`). All cryptographic
operations happen in Rust. Flutter receives only public information and
status. Supports session recovery via Mostro daemon.

## Functions

### create_identity() → IdentityCreationResult
Create a new Nostr keypair with BIP-39 mnemonic.

**Returns**:
```text
IdentityCreationResult {
  public_key: String       # Hex-encoded public key
  mnemonic_words: Vec<String>  # 12-word BIP-39 mnemonic (show once, user must back up)
}
```

**Side effects**: Stores encrypted private key in platform secure storage.

**Errors**: `StorageError` if secure storage unavailable.

---

### import_from_mnemonic(words: Vec<String>, recover: bool) → IdentityInfo
Import identity from BIP-39 mnemonic phrase. If `recover` is true,
sends `Action.restore` to Mostro daemon to recover active trades and
disputes.

**Validation**: Words MUST be valid BIP-39 English wordlist, 12 or 24 words.

**Recovery flow** (when `recover = true`):
1. Derive master key from mnemonic (BIP-32 path N=0).
2. Send `Action.restore` to Mostro daemon via NIP-44 (Kind 14).
3. Receive list of order IDs + dispute IDs.
4. Request details for each order/dispute.
5. Sync trade key index: send `Action.last_trade_index` (rumor authored by a
   trade key; the daemon resolves the account from the identity proof) and
   raise the local counter to the reply's `trade_index` — the daemon's
   authoritative high-water mark, which includes finalized trades the restore
   payload omits (#328). If the daemon refuses (`CantDo`) or does not answer,
   fall back to the maximum trade index in the restore payload (a lower
   bound: the payload lists only non-finalized orders). The counter is only
   ever raised, never lowered; re-asking is idempotent.
6. Reconstruct local DB from daemon responses.
7. Keep the history the relays replay out of the app. Widening the kind-14
   filter to every recovered trade key makes the relays replay the account's
   whole daemon history, on the restore and on every start after it. A trade
   at or below the resync floor that the restore did not list is history
   (`mostro::restore_history`), and an imported account never shows it:
   - its replayed messages read as a wiped trade's (`RowState::Wiped`): no
     row, session or subscription is created for it;
   - a history pass drops any row of it that exists (with the tombstone that
     mutes later replays), announcing nothing, and `list_trades` leaves such
     rows out until the pass runs;
   - every TradeUpdate a replayed event causes is dated by that event —
     including the payout found on the book and the public `canceled` that
     drops a never-active trade — so Notifications files it as history, not
     as "just now", and an invoice request whose step window ran out opens
     no screen.

**Note**: Recovery only works if identity is NOT in privacy mode.

**Errors**: `InvalidMnemonic`, `StorageError`, `RecoveryFailed`,
`PrivacyModeRecoveryUnavailable`.

---

### import_from_nsec(nsec: String) → IdentityInfo
Import identity from nsec (bech32-encoded private key).

**Validation**: MUST be valid bech32 nsec format.

**Errors**: `InvalidKey`, `StorageError`.

---

### get_identity() → IdentityInfo?
Get current identity info. Returns null if no identity exists.

---

### export_encrypted_backup(passphrase: String) → String
Export identity as encrypted backup string.

**Returns**: Encrypted payload (NIP-49 compatible or custom format).

**Errors**: `NoIdentity`, `EncryptionError`.

---

### funds_at_risk() → Vec<FundsAtRisk>
What the current identity would lose if it were replaced now, most serious
first; empty when it is safe to go ahead (issue #533). Local rows only — no
relay round trip.

`FundsAtRisk { order_id, reason, amount_sats? }`, where `reason` is a marker
Dart localizes:

| `reason` | When |
|---|---|
| `SellerEscrowLocked` | the user is the seller and the trade is `active`, `fiat-sent` or `dispute` — decided on the status, so a restored row with no bolt11 counts too |
| `BondLocked` | the trade's bond is `Locked` |
| `PayoutClaimOpen` | a `bond_claims` row in a non-terminal phase, inside its window |
| `TradeInProgress` | a live trade with none of the user's sats locked (a buyer mid-trade, either side before the escrow is funded) |
| `BondInvoicePending` | a `Requested` bond whose invoice has not expired |

The Account screen calls it **before** generating a user or importing a
seed — before anything is written — and shows a warning that lists the
entries. It warns, it does not block: the safe action is the primary one, a
dismissal counts as it, and going on still leads to the usual confirmation.
A check that fails reads as empty, so it cannot lock the user out of
rotating a compromised identity.

---

### delete_identity() → ()
Delete identity from device. Irreversible.

**Side effects**: the next identity finds the app as a fresh install leaves
it (issue #533).

- Gives back the identity's relay subscriptions first — d-tag watchers,
  daemon-message watchers, chats and the bulk kind-14 feed — so nothing of
  the old user's keeps arriving.
- Unregisters every push registration.
- Wipes what the identity produced: the identity row, trade keys, trades,
  chat messages, payout claims, the outbound queue, the cached order book
  (its `is_mine` marks) and the per-order settings (chat and status cursors,
  dispute markers, invoice-step starts, wipe tombstones, retained claim
  nodes, the last restore's snapshot). `Storage::clear_identity_data`, one
  transaction on native.
- The restore snapshot also names the identity that took it. A history pass
  ignores (and drops) any snapshot that is not the loaded identity's,
  including one stored before snapshots named theirs, and any snapshot whose
  floor is above the identity's trade-key counter (the key sequence started
  over, e.g. a re-import after a failed wipe). Read otherwise, its floor and
  live set would take this identity's new takes for history and wipe them
  mid-trade (#614).
- Empties the in-memory stores: disputes, ratings, sessions, chats (unread
  count published as zero), trade-key caches; then re-issues the public
  subscriptions so the book refills with no order marked as own.
- Clears the log buffer.

**Kept**: device preferences — relays, the active and custom nodes, node
caches, the push token and toggle, developer overrides. They belong to the
device, not to the identity.

A failed wipe is logged, never turned into a failed deletion: by then the
identity is already gone. The Dart half — cached providers and the
notifications store — is `resetIdentityScopedState`, run by the Account
screen after a generate and, on import, **before** the recovery.

**Errors**: `NoIdentity`.

---

### set_pin(pin: String) → ()
Set or update device unlock PIN.

**Validation**: PIN MUST be 4-8 digits.

**Errors**: `NoIdentity`, `StorageError`.

---

### enable_biometric() → bool
Enable biometric unlock. Returns true if biometric hardware available.

**Errors**: `BiometricUnavailable`, `NoIdentity`.

---

### unlock(pin: String) → bool
Unlock the app with PIN. Returns true if correct.

**Errors**: `NoIdentity`, `MaxAttemptsExceeded`.

---

### derive_trade_key() → TradeKeyInfo
Derive a new trade-specific key for an order. Auto-increments the
trade key index.

**Returns**:
```text
TradeKeyInfo {
  index: u32           # BIP-32 index N
  public_key: String   # Trade key public key (hex)
}
```

**Side effects**: Increments `trade_key_index` on Identity. Persists
new index to storage.

**Errors**: `NoIdentity`.

---

### get_trade_key(index: u32) → TradeKeyInfo
Get a previously derived trade key by index. Used during recovery
and for re-deriving keys for existing trades.

**Errors**: `NoIdentity`, `InvalidIndex`.

---

### get_nym_identity(pubkey: String) → NymIdentity
Derive a deterministic pseudonym, icon index, and color hue from any
public key. Same input always yields the same output across sessions
and devices.

**Returns**: See `NymIdentity` in types.md
(`pseudonym: String`, `icon_index: u8 (0–36)`, `color_hue: u16 (0–359)`)

**Errors**: `InvalidPublicKey`.

## Streams

### on_identity_changed() → Stream<IdentityInfo?>
Emits when identity is created, imported, or deleted.

### on_recovery_progress() → Stream<RecoveryProgress>
Emits during session recovery to update UI progress.

```text
RecoveryProgress {
  phase: String          # "connecting", "fetching_orders", "syncing"
  current: u32           # Current item being processed
  total: u32             # Total items to process
}
```
