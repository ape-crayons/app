# Tasks: Mostro Mobile v2 — P2P Bitcoin Lightning Exchange

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/004-mostro-p2p-client/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, spec.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ (9 files) ✅, quickstart.md ✅

**Tests**: Not requested — no test tasks included.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story (15 stories + foundation) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. V1_FLOW_GUIDE.md section references are noted per story for implementation guidance.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no cross-story dependencies)
- **[Story]**: User story (US1–US15) from spec.md
- All paths are relative to repository root

## Task status legend

- `[x]` — Done: fully implemented and verified
- `[~]` — Partial: code exists but blocked on missing infrastructure (noted in description)
- `[ ]` — Not started

## Open work at a glance

Most of what follows (T001–T145) is `[x]` — the phases read as a
completed build log, not a live backlog. What's actually still open lives
in two clusters of `[~]` partial tasks (code exists, but the backend or
the UI wiring doesn't):

- **IndexedDB / web storage** (Phase 1 — Setup): T010 — only messages,
  settings and the active Mostro pubkey are implemented; orders, trades,
  relays, identity, queued messages and trade keys return "IndexedDB not
  yet implemented", so the web target cannot persist a trade (#233).
- **Dispute admin chat** (Phase 12 — Dispute System): T088 — the list is
  fed on resume only (#397). T090–T093 are done (#143, #589 phase 3).

Plus one task with no entry at all: **restore from mnemonic** — see T148
below.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Bootstrap the monorepo, configure all toolchains, install dependencies.

- [x] T001 Create full directory structure per plan.md: `lib/features/`, `lib/core/`, `lib/shared/`, `rust/src/api/`, `rust/src/db/`, `rust/src/nostr/`, `rust/src/crypto/`, `rust/src/mostro/`, `rust/src/nwc/`, `rust/src/queue/`, `assets/data/`, `assets/images/`, `assets/l10n/`
- [x] T002 Configure `rust/Cargo.toml` with all dependencies: `nostr-sdk 0.44+`, `mostro-core 0.8+`, `flutter_rust_bridge 2.x`, `sqlx` (features: sqlite, runtime-tokio), `indexed_db_futures`, `bip32`, `bip39`, `chacha20poly1305`, `tokio` (rt-multi-thread, native only), `wasm-bindgen-futures` (wasm only)
- [x] T003 [P] Configure `pubspec.yaml` with Flutter dependencies: `flutter_rust_bridge 2.x`, `riverpod`/`flutter_riverpod`, `go_router`, `sembast`, `flutter_secure_storage`, `introduction_screen`, `qr_flutter`, `mobile_scanner`, `intl`, `shared_preferences` (historical: `introduction_screen` was dropped for a custom walkthrough with `flutter_svg` in #764)
- [x] T004 Configure `rust/build.rs` to invoke `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate` and set up `rust_builder/` scaffolding for wasm-pack web builds
- [x] T005 [P] Add Rust WASM target and document in `quickstart.md`: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`; add `wasm-pack` and `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` to prerequisites
- [x] T006 [P] Configure linting: `.clippy.toml` (Rust, deny warnings), `analysis_options.yaml` (Flutter, strict), pre-commit hooks running `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` and `flutter analyze`
- [x] T007 [P] Populate `assets/data/fiat.json` with full fiat currency list (ISO 4217 code, name, country flag emoji); create placeholder walkthrough images `assets/images/wt-1.png` through `wt-6.png`; create skeleton ARB files `assets/l10n/app_en.arb`, `app_es.arb`, `app_it.arb`, `app_fr.arb`, `app_de.arb` (historical: those PNG placeholders were replaced by the real `wt-1.webp` … `wt-6.webp` illustrations in #264, and those by the SVG layers in `assets/images/walkthrough/` in #764)

**Checkpoint**: `flutter pub get`, `cd rust && cargo build`, `flutter analyze` all pass.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Cross-cutting infrastructure that EVERY user story depends on. No story work can begin until this phase is complete.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: All phases 3–17 are blocked until this phase is complete.

- [x] T008 Implement all shared types in `rust/src/api/types.rs`: all enums (`OrderKind`, `OrderStatus` with 15 states, `TradeRole`, `BuyerStep`, `SellerStep`, `TradeStep`, `TradeOutcome`, `MessageType`, `DisputeStatus`, `RelayStatus`, `ConnectionState`, `WalletStatus`, `ThemeMode`, `FileType`, `DownloadStatus`, `QueuedMessageStatus`, `CooperativeCancelState`) and all structs (`OrderInfo`, `TradeInfo`, `ChatMessage`, `AttachmentInfo`, `RelayInfo`, `IdentityInfo`, `NymIdentity`, `AppState`, `LogEntry`) per `contracts/types.md`. Mark `flutter_rust_bridge` annotations. Note: `PaymentFailed` is NOT a status — it is an Action notification only.
- [x] T009 Implement storage trait in `rust/src/db/mod.rs` defining async CRUD interface for all entities (Identity, Order, Trade, Message, Relay, Dispute, Settings, MessageQueue, NwcWallet, FileAttachment, Rating). Implement SQLite backend in `rust/src/db/sqlite.rs` using `sqlx` with full schema migrations for all 11 entities per `data-model.md`.
- [~] T010 [P] Implement IndexedDB storage backend in `rust/src/db/indexeddb.rs` using `indexed_db_futures`, feature-gated with `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]`. Must implement the same trait as `sqlite.rs` and support all 11 entities. **Partial**: only messages (save/list/mark-read/exists), settings and the active Mostro pubkey are backed by real object stores; orders, trades, relays, identity, queued messages and trade keys still return `IndexedDB not yet implemented` — see #233.

> **Transport v2 note**: T011/T012/T039/T040/T049/T066/T071/T085/T137 below describe the original NIP-59 gift-wrap (Kind 1059) transport implemented in 004. Messages to the Mostro daemon were later migrated to transport v2 (NIP-44, signed Kind 14), and peer/dispute chat followed in #246, moving to the Kind 14 chat envelope. Kind 1059 is gone from both directions, so these task descriptions are a record of what 004 built, not of what ships. These task records are kept as-is for history.

- [x] T011 [P] Implement NIP-59 Gift Wrap encode/decode in `rust/src/nostr/gift_wrap.rs` using `nostr-sdk`: create unsigned rumor event, encrypt into Seal (Kind 13, NIP-44), wrap into Gift Wrap (Kind 1059, ephemeral key). Export `wrap_message(content, recipient_pubkey, sender_key)` and `unwrap_message(gift_wrap_event, recipient_key)`. _(Superseded — see the Transport v2 note above.)_
- [x] T012 [P] Implement relay pool with Kind 1059 + Kind 38383 subscriptions in `rust/src/nostr/relay_pool.rs` using `nostr-sdk`. Multi-relay connection manager: connect, disconnect, add/remove relays, subscribe to order events (Kind 38383) and gift-wrap DMs (Kind 1059 targeting user's trade keys), emit events via channels. _(Superseded — see the Transport v2 note above.)_
- [x] T013 [P] Implement offline message queue in `rust/src/queue/outbox.rs`: persist queued Nostr events to DB (entity: `MessageQueue`), retry on reconnection up to 10 attempts, prune `Sent` items after 24 hours, expose `queue_message(event_json, target_relays)` and `flush_queue()`.
- [x] T014 Implement app design system tokens in `lib/core/app_theme.dart`: colors (`mostroGreen #8CC63F`, `purpleButton #7856AF`, `sellRed #FF8A8A`, `errorRed #EF6A6A`, dark background, card background, text primary/secondary, input background), typography scale, spacing constants, component styles for buttons (filled/outline), cards, chips/badges. Dark and light theme variants. Matches `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` exactly.
- [x] T015 [P] Implement GoRouter route definitions scaffold in `lib/core/app_routes.dart` with all 23 routes: `/walkthrough`, `/`, `/add_order`, `/take_sell/:orderId`, `/take_buy/:orderId`, `/pay_invoice/:orderId`, `/add_invoice/:orderId`, `/trade_detail/:orderId`, `/order_book`, `/chat_list`, `/chat_room/:orderId`, `/key_management`, `/settings`, `/about`, `/notifications`, `/relays`, `/wallet_settings`, `/connect_wallet`, `/rate_user/:orderId`, `/dispute_details/:disputeId`, `/notification_settings`, `/logs`, `/dispute_chat/:disputeId`. All routes are stubs returning placeholder `Scaffold` at this stage; redirect logic added in US1 phase.
- [x] T016 Implement app bootstrap in `lib/core/app.dart`: `ProviderScope` wrapping `MaterialApp.router` with GoRouter, `AppTheme` themes (dark default), locale resolution, `flutter_rust_bridge` Rust library initialization on startup. Initialize Nostr relay pool on startup.

**Checkpoint**: App launches to a blank scaffold on all 5 platforms. `cargo test` passes. `flutter analyze` clean.

---

## Phase 2b: Default Configuration (Relays + Mostro Node)

**Purpose**: Seed the app with default relay URLs and the default Mostro node
pubkey so it can connect to the network on first launch without any user
configuration.

**Depends on**: Phase 2 (T008, T009)
**Blocks**: T012 (relay pool initialization), T029 (Nostr relay API)

- [x] T012b Create `rust/src/config.rs` with hardcoded seed constants:
  - `DEFAULT_RELAYS: &[&str]` = `["wss://relay.mostro.network", "wss://nos.lol",
    "wss://mostro-p2p.tech", "wss://relay.shadowbip.com"]` — the default node's
    own kind 10002 relay list; see `contracts/settings.md` → Default Relays
  - `DEFAULT_MOSTRO_PUBKEY: &str` = `"82fa8cb978b43c79b2156585bac2c011176a21d2aead6d9f7c575c005be88390"`
  - `DEFAULT_MOSTRO_NAME: &str` = `"Mostro"`
  - Export from `lib.rs`

- [x] T012c On first launch (no relays in DB), seed DB with `DEFAULT_RELAYS` as
  `RelayInfo { url, user_added: false, enabled: true }`. Default relays are NOT
  deletable from the UI (only disable allowed). Implement in `rust/src/db/seeds.rs`.

- [x] T012d On first launch (no Mostro node selected), seed the active Mostro node
  with `DEFAULT_MOSTRO_PUBKEY` + `DEFAULT_MOSTRO_NAME`. Store in settings as
  `active_mostro_pubkey`. Implement in same `rust/src/db/seeds.rs`.

- [x] T012e Wire `seeds::seed_defaults()` into app bootstrap (called once after DB
  migration, before relay pool initialization). Guard with `IF NOT EXISTS` checks
  so re-runs are idempotent.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 — First Launch & Identity Setup (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP Start

**V1 ref**: Section 1 (`WALKTHROUGH_SCREEN.md`, `SESSION_AND_KEY_MANAGEMENT.md`, `AUTHENTICATION.md`)

**Goal**: New user sees walkthrough once, app silently creates identity, subsequent launches skip to home.

**Independent Test**: Fresh install → 6-slide walkthrough appears → Done/Skip → order book (blank). Reinstall same device → walkthrough skipped, goes direct to home.

- [x] T017 Implement BIP-39/BIP-32 key derivation in `rust/src/crypto/keys.rs`: `generate_mnemonic()` → 12-word BIP-39, `derive_master_key(mnemonic)` → identity key at path `m/44'/1237'/38383'/0/0`, `derive_trade_key(mnemonic, index)` → trade key at `m/44'/1237'/38383'/0/N`. Use `bip32` + `bip39` crates.
- [x] T018 [P] Implement ECDH shared key derivation in `rust/src/crypto/ecdh.rs`: `derive_shared_key(my_privkey, peer_pubkey)` → 32-byte shared secret. Used for P2P chat encryption (trade key + peer trade key).
- [x] T019 [P] Implement deterministic nym identity in `rust/src/crypto/nym.rs`: `get_nym_identity(pubkey)` → `NymIdentity { pseudonym, icon_index, color_hue }`. Pseudonym = adjective-noun format derived deterministically from pubkey bytes. Icon index 0–36, color hue 0–359. Same pubkey → same result always. See `contracts/identity.md` → `get_nym_identity`.
- [x] T020 Implement identity API in `rust/src/api/identity.rs` per `contracts/identity.md`: `create_identity()`, `get_identity()`, `import_from_mnemonic()`, `derive_trade_key()`, `get_trade_key()`, `get_nym_identity()`, `delete_identity()`, `export_encrypted_backup()`. `create_identity()` stores encrypted private key via `flutter_secure_storage` bridge (key never leaves device unencrypted). Emit `on_identity_changed()` stream.
- [x] T021 Implement walkthrough screen (6 slides) in `lib/features/walkthrough/screens/walkthrough_screen.dart` using `introduction_screen` package. Slides per `WALKTHROUGH_SCREEN.md`: Page 1 Welcome, Page 2 Privacy by Default, Page 3 Security, Page 4 Encrypted Chat, Page 5 Take an Offer, Page 6 Create Your Own Offer. Navigation: Skip (top-left), ← / → arrows, Done (last slide). Dots indicator (active = pill 16x8, inactive = circle 8x8). (historical: #764 replaced this with the v2 onboarding: segmented progress and step counter, round Back beside a full-width Next/Done, Skip as a link under the actions, swipe and arrow keys; no `introduction_screen`, no dots)
- [x] T022 [P] Implement highlight config in `lib/features/walkthrough/utils/highlight_config.dart`: regex patterns to highlight key terms in green (`AppTheme.mostroGreen`, semibold w600) per slide. Terms: "Nostr"/"no KYC"/"censorship-resistant" (S1), "Reputation mode"/"Full privacy mode" (S2), "Hold Invoices" (S3), "end-to-end encrypted" (S4), "order book" (S5), "create your own offer" (S6). All 5 languages supported. (historical: removed in #764; the v2 copy carries no inline highlights, and the privacy modes are cards)
- [x] T023 Implement first-run provider in `lib/features/walkthrough/providers/first_run_provider.dart` using `shared_preferences`: `firstRunComplete` bool key. `markFirstRunComplete()` sets it to `true`. Activates `backupReminderProvider.showBackupReminder()` on completion.
- [x] T024 Wire GoRouter redirect in `lib/core/app_routes.dart`: if `firstRunComplete == false` → redirect all routes to `/walkthrough`; after walkthrough Done/Skip → set `firstRunComplete = true` → navigate to `/`. On first launch, `create_identity()` is called before the walkthrough is shown (invisible to user).

**Checkpoint**: Fresh launch shows walkthrough, Done/Skip lands on blank home, subsequent launches skip walkthrough. Identity created silently.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 — Secret Words Backup (Priority: P1)

**V1 ref**: Section 2 (`NOTIFICATIONS_SYSTEM.md`, `ACCOUNT_SCREEN.md`)

**Goal**: Backup reminder pinned in notifications, bell shows red dot, passing the 3-step backup's word verification clears it permanently (T027b; the checkbox of T027 is superseded).

**Independent Test**: After walkthrough → bell has red dot + shake animation. Open Notifications → pinned backup card (not swipeable, not removed by "Mark all as read"). Tap → Account screen shows the amber banner (no words card) → banner → sheet → `Back up now` → step 1: the 12 words → step 2: 3 fixed slots asked at random (`View words` returns to the words keeping solved slots; `Confirm` disabled until all 3 are right) → `Confirm` → step 3: done → red dot gone permanently and Account shows the masked Secret Words card with the `Backed up` chip.

- [x] T025 Implement notification bell widget in `lib/shared/widgets/notification_bell.dart`: two states — (1) red dot (no number, before backup complete), (2) dark-gold pill badge with white number (after backup, count of unreads). Bell plays left-right shake animation (`AnimationController`) whenever any indicator is active. Integrates with `backupReminderProvider` and `unreadNotificationCountProvider`.
- [x] T026 [P] Implement backup reminder provider in `lib/features/account/providers/backup_reminder_provider.dart`: persists `backupReminderDismissed` bool in `SharedPreferences`. `showBackupReminder()` activates the red dot. `confirmBackupComplete()` sets dismissed = true, removes red dot permanently.
- [x] T027 Implement account screen in `lib/features/account/screens/account_screen.dart` with first card: "Secret Words". **Updated (spec.md US2)**: (1) mnemonic is FULLY masked by default (all 12 words as `•••`, none visible); (2) "Show" button reveals all 12 words AND simultaneously animates in a confirmation checkbox (`AnimatedSize`, 200ms ease-in-out) with label "I have written down my words and backed them up securely"; (3) `confirmBackupComplete()` is called ONLY when the user ticks the checkbox — viewing words alone does NOT confirm backup; (4) "Generate New User" resets `_wordsVisible`, `_showBackupCheckbox`, and `_words` before reactivating the reminder. Route: `/key_management`.
- [x] T027b Redesign Account and the backup flow per `design_handoff_cuenta_respaldo/README.md` (15a–15c Account and its sheet, 16a–16d the 3-step backup). **Supersedes T027's checkbox and T147.** Account renders exactly one of two blocks, keyed on `backupCompletedProvider`: the amber `Secure your reputation` banner (opens the 15c sheet) until the backup is confirmed, the Secret Words card afterwards — 2 × 6 Manrope grid masked as `••••••••`, `Backed up` chip, `Show words` reveals with only `Hide` / `Copy` (no checkbox; copy turns into a check for 1.2 s), masked again when the screen is left. The public key card is removed (`PublicKeyCard` deleted). Privacy card with the new mode subtitles; lime `Generate new user`, outlined `Import` + refresh. Sheet: `Remind me tomorrow` → `I'll do it later` (still snoozes the bell dot a day; the banner stays). Flow: app bar titles `Step n of 3 · …` with a 3-segment progress bar, no arrow on 16d; verification slots with a fixed 76 dp nowrap label; `Show words again` → `View words`, which now keeps the solved slots (only a second miss on one word restarts, #223); system back while verifying reviews the words. Verification is an immutable `BackupVerification` in `backup_rules.dart` (+ unit tests); tokens in `BackupPalette` (+ contrast test); `redesignAppBar` accepts a null `onBack`; goldens `account_15a…16d_*`.
- [x] T028 Implement notifications screen in `lib/features/notifications/screens/notifications_screen.dart`: scrollable card list, overflow menu with "Mark all as read" and "Clear all". Pinned backup reminder card always first (gavel/key icon, title "You must back up your account") — rendered from `backupReminderProvider` state, NOT from the notifications list, so it is immune to `markAllAsRead()`, `deleteAll()`, and swipe-to-dismiss. Tap on backup card → `/key_management`. Route: `/notifications`. Bell in AppBar taps to this screen.

**Checkpoint**: Backup reminder flow works end-to-end: red dot → open notifications (reminder stays through mark-all-read) → tap reminder → Account screen (banner only) → sheet → write down the words → verify 3 random words (review keeps progress) → confirm → dot clears permanently and Account swaps the banner for the masked words card.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 — Browse the Order Book (Priority: P1)

**V1 ref**: Sections 3–5 (`HOME_SCREEN.md`, `ORDER_BOOK.md`)

**Goal**: Public order book with BUY/SELL tabs, order cards, and filter dialog. Tapping a card navigates to Take Order.

**Independent Test**: App shows two tabs with mock order list. Filter by "ARS" → only ARS orders shown. Tap order card → Take Order screen (stub). Empty state appears when no orders match.

- [x] T029 Implement Nostr relay API in `rust/src/api/nostr.rs` per `contracts/nostr.md`: `initialize(relays)`, `add_relay(url)`, `remove_relay(url)`, `get_relays()`, `get_connection_state()`, `flush_message_queue()`. Streams: `on_connection_state_changed()`, `on_relay_status_changed()`. Wire into relay pool from T012.
- [x] T030 [P] Implement Kind 38383 order event parsing in `rust/src/nostr/order_events.rs`: parse Nostr event tags to `OrderInfo` struct (kind, status, fiat_amount, fiat_code, premium, payment_method, creator_pubkey, created_at, expires_at). Use `mostro-core` types for deserialization. Only surface `status == Pending` orders.
- [x] T031 [P] Implement orders API read path in `rust/src/api/orders.rs` per `contracts/orders.md`: `get_orders(filters)` subscribes to Kind 38383 events from relay pool, caches locally, applies `OrderFilters` (kind, fiat_code, payment_method). Returns `Vec<OrderInfo>` sorted by ascending expiration. Stream: `on_orders_updated()` emits on any order list change.
- [x] T032 Implement home screen in `lib/features/home/screens/home_screen.dart`: AppBar (hamburger ☰ left, Mostro logo center — green skull, tappable 500ms happy face, notification bell right), BUY BTC / SELL BTC tabs (swipeable), filter pill below tabs (funnel icon + "FILTER" + offer count), scrollable order list, green FAB bottom-right, bottom nav bar (3 tabs). Tab logic: "BUY BTC" tab → shows **sell** orders (taker buys); "SELL BTC" tab → shows **buy** orders (taker sells). Labels are from the taker's perspective per V1_FLOW_GUIDE.md §3.
- [x] T033 [P] Implement order list item card widget in `lib/features/home/widgets/order_list_item.dart` with 5 rows: (1) status pill "SELLING"/"BUYING" + relative timestamp, (2) fiat amount/range in large bold + currency code + flag emoji, (3) price type label "Market Price (+5.0%)" with premium in green/red, (4) nested dark card with payment icon + comma-separated methods (truncated with "..."), (5) nested dark card with star rating (fractional fill) + trade count + days active. Skeleton shimmer for loading state. Empty state: centered icon + "No orders available".
- [x] T034 [P] Implement order book stream providers in `lib/features/home/providers/home_order_providers.dart`: `orderBookProvider` (StreamProvider from Rust), `homeOrderTypeProvider` (StateProvider: buy/sell tab), `currencyFilterProvider`, `paymentMethodFilterProvider`, `ratingFilterProvider`, `premiumRangeFilterProvider` (all StateProviders). `filteredOrdersProvider` (Provider) applies all filters to pending orders.
- [x] T035 [P] Implement order filter dialog in `lib/shared/widgets/order_filter.dart`: multi-select currency chips, multi-select payment method chips, rating range slider (0–5.0), premium range slider (-10%–+10%), Reset button. Reads/writes the individual filter providers. Shown via `showDialog` from HomeScreen.
- [x] T036 [P] Implement bottom navigation bar in `lib/shared/widgets/bottom_nav_bar.dart`: 3 tabs (Order Book / list-icon, My Trades / lightning-bolt, Chat / speech-bubble). My Trades tab has red dot badge when `orderBookNotificationCountProvider > 0`. Chat tab has red dot badge when `chatCountProvider > 0`. Active tab icon + label in green `#8CC63F`. GoRouter integration.
- [x] T149 Swipe between the order book's Buy and Sell tabs: a horizontal swipe over the list (`lib/features/home/widgets/side_swipe.dart`, wrapped around the list in `home_screen.dart`) switches side like the tabs are laid out — left brings Sell, right brings Buy, past the last tab nothing — above `minSideSwipeVelocity` (300 dp/s); a vertical drag still scrolls. Pure rule `sideAfterSwipe` + widget tests in `test/features/home/side_swipe_test.dart`.
- [x] T037 [P] Implement drawer menu in `lib/features/drawer/screens/drawer_menu.dart`: slides from left, ~70% screen width, 30% black overlay behind. Header: Mostro mascot icon + "Beta" label + "MOSTRO" title. 3 menu items (Account `/key_management`, Settings `/settings`, About `/about`) with white outline icons + white labels. Generous vertical spacing.

**Checkpoint**: Order book renders with live or mocked order cards. Both tabs work. Filter reduces list. Tap card → stub Take Order screen opens.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 — Create an Order (Priority: P1)

**V1 ref**: Section 7 (`ORDER_CREATION.md`)

**Goal**: FAB expands into Buy/Sell buttons; Create Order form validates and submits; order appears in My Trades as Pending.

**Independent Test**: Tap FAB → two sub-buttons appear. Tap Sell → form opens pre-set to Sell. Fill all fields → Submit enabled → Submit → trade appears in My Trades as Pending.

- [x] T038 Implement Mostro protocol FSM in `rust/src/mostro/fsm.rs`: 15 `OrderStatus` states, allowed action-per-role table (buyer/seller × status → allowed actions), `next_status(current, action, role)` function. Reference: `data-model.md` state machine and `contracts/types.md`.
- [x] T039 [P] Implement Mostro action dispatch in `rust/src/mostro/actions.rs`: `new_order(params)`, `take_buy(order_id, amount)`, `take_sell(order_id, amount)`. Each builds a `MostroMessage` using `mostro-core` types, wraps via NIP-59 Gift Wrap, publishes to relays. On success returns updated `OrderInfo`.
- [x] T040 Implement orders API write path in `rust/src/api/orders.rs`: add `create_order(params: NewOrderParams)` per `contracts/orders.md`. Validates params (fiat_amount XOR range; fiat_code valid; payment_method non-empty), builds `MostroMessage(action: NewOrder)`, wraps NIP-59, publishes. Queues if offline.
- [x] T041 Implement AddOrderButton FAB widget in `lib/shared/widgets/add_order_button.dart`: collapsed state = circular 56dp green `#8CC63F` "+" button. On tap: main FAB → gray "×", dark overlay (~30% black), two stacked rectangular buttons: Buy (green `#8CC63F`, down-lightning-bolt, navigates to `/add_order?type=buy`) and Sell (salmon `#FF8A8A`, up-lightning-bolt, navigates to `/add_order?type=sell`). Tap overlay or "×" collapses back.
- [x] T042 Implement create order screen in `lib/features/order/screens/add_order_screen.dart`: AppBar "CREATING NEW ORDER". 4 cards: (1) "You want to sell/buy Bitcoin" + fiat amount input + currency selector, (2) payment methods multi-select + custom text input, (3) Market/Fixed price toggle with info icon, (4) Premium slider -10%–+10% (visible only in market mode). Bottom bar: Cancel (gray outline) + Submit (green filled, disabled until valid). Reads `orderType` from route extra. Pre-fills `defaultFiatCode` and `defaultLightningAddress` from settings. The currency selector offers only the codes in the active node's `fiat_currencies_accepted`, as Rust parsed it from the node's cached kind 38385 event (`cachedMostroNodeStats`, reread whenever the startup warm-up, the node selector's fetch or the live fetch behind `mostroNodeProvider` writes that cache; a previous node's list is dropped while a new one loads, and a reread of the same node keeps its list until the read returns), the whole `fiat.json` catalogue while that list is unknown or empty (mostrod reads empty as any currency); an accepted code missing from the catalogue is listed by its code (`offeredFiatCodes` in `create_order_rules.dart`). A selected currency the node does not accept gives way to the first code the node lists, without changing the settings default (`fiatForNode`), but only while the form is untouched (no currency picked by the user, no amount, fixed sats or payment method): the settings default on open, or any currency when the node's list arrives late or changes with a node switch. On a form the user already touched, the currency stays, the preview shows it as refused (`orderCurrencyNotAccepted`) and Publish is disabled (`fiatRefused`).
- [x] T043 [P] Implement currency section widget (tappable, opens currency dialog) in `lib/features/order/widgets/currency_section.dart`: reads from `selectedFiatCodeProvider`. Shows selected code + flag.
- [x] T044 [P] Implement payment method section (multi-select dropdown + custom text field) in `lib/features/order/widgets/payment_method_section.dart`: opens multi-select list, shows selected methods as chips, custom text input field below.
- [x] T045 [P] Implement price type + premium section in `lib/features/order/widgets/price_section.dart`: Market/Fixed toggle (switch). Market mode: slider -10%–+10% with editable numeric field on purple background + pencil icon. Fixed mode: sats input field.
- [x] T046 Wire create order form submission in `add_order_screen.dart`: on Submit → call `create_order()` via Rust bridge → on success navigate to the order screen; on no daemon response, show the localized `sessionTimeoutMessage` and stay on the form (no order is created); validate fiat amount against Mostro instance min/max limits from `MostroInstance`.

- [x] T046b Redesign the create order screen per `design_handoff_crear_orden/README.md` (5a range at market price, 5b single amount at fixed price, 5c component details): app bar "New order"; `Buy BTC | Sell BTC` segmented control replaces the informational "You want to sell/buy" line; the range and price switches become `Single | Range` and `Market | Fixed` segmented controls; the premium block is tinted by whom the premium favours **from the maker's side** (`create_order_rules.dart::premiumFavour`, not the order book's taker-side rule) and the figure is tapped to edit; payment methods are chips plus an `Add` chip that opens a full-screen picker holding the search, the per-currency list and the custom-method field, and releases the amount field's focus first, so the form comes back with the keyboard closed and `Publish order` reachable; the live preview is one line pinned above `Cancel` / `Publish order`; the node's `expiration_hours` is read into the preview, never edited. Presets (Express / Conservative / Custom) are removed: the form is always the full form. Premium stays a whole percent (mostro-core `i64`); quick-amount chips approximate 10/25/50/100 USD from the node's rates.

**Checkpoint**: Full create order flow works. Submitted order appears in My Trades as Pending. FAB expands/collapses correctly.

## Phase 7: User Story 5 — Take an Existing Order (Priority: P1)

**V1 ref**: Section 8 (`TAKE_ORDER.md`), Section 10 (Range Amount Modal)

**Goal**: Tapping someone else's order card opens the take-order screen (`Buy BTC` / `Sell BTC`); tapping `Take order` (with the range modal if needed) takes the order and goes straight to the invoice step; tapping an own order opens the maker's own-order screen.

**Independent Test**: Tap a sell order card → `Buy BTC` screen with the countdown in the app bar, amount / counterparty / data blocks and a single `Take order` button. Tap it on a range order → modal appears, enter amount → submit → navigates to Add Invoice screen. Let another client take the order while the screen is open → the button reads `No longer available` in place.

- [x] T046c Redesign the maker's own-order screen per `design_handoff_detalle_orden/README.md` (6a screen, 6b status states): app bar `Your sell order` / `Your buy order` in sentence case; three blocks with a hierarchy — amount (side chip + currency chip, Manrope 34 figure that drops to 28 before wrapping, price line coloured from the **maker's** side via `create_order_rules.dart::premiumFavour`), status (the only coloured block: pulsing dot with a still ring while waiting, `h:mm` countdown above an hour / `mm:ss` under it, elapsed-life bar, "Published N ago" note; colour family per state in `OrderDetailPalette`, 200 ms cross-fade and a haptic nudge on a relay-driven change), data card (`label → value` rows: payment methods with `+N` and a sheet beyond two, created date, id cut in the middle and copied by tapping the whole row). Bottom bar: `Close` filled lime, `Cancel` outlined coral opening a confirmation sheet (never a one-tap cancel); `Cancel` hidden in terminal states. Pure rules in `order_detail_rules.dart`.
- [x] T046d Redesign the take-order screen per `design_handoff_tomar_orden/README.md` (7a): app bar names the taker's action (`Buy BTC` / `Sell BTC`) with the countdown on the right (amber under an hour, coral under five minutes; `Closed` once the order is gone); amount block `You pay {fiat}` / `You receive ≈ {sats}` (estimate from `exchangeRateProvider`, refreshed every 30 s with a 150 ms cross-fade; `from ≈` on a range; the exact figure on fixed-sats orders), footer coloured from the **taker's** side (`takerPremiumFavour`); counterparty card (rating avatar or `New`, role, trades · days on Mostro; hidden in privacy mode); data card (pay-with, published, id); action bar with the escrow note and a single `Take order` button (`Taking…` on a lime tint while the relay answers, `No longer available` dead in place if the order is taken by someone else or expires — the user is never thrown out). No confirmation step: the button goes straight to the existing Lightning step.
- [x] T046e Redesign the node selector per `design_handoff_selector_nodo/README.md` (9a sheet, 9b custom-node dialog and availability states): one flat list — the `Trusted` / `Custom` section headers are removed, the `DE CONFIANZA` chip (9 px) on the card says it — ordered by open orders in the user's preferred currency (`settings.fiatCode`), unreachable nodes last at 55 % opacity and not selectable; each card (`lib/features/settings/widgets/node_card.dart`, radius 18) answers "does it serve me?" — accepted-currency chips with the user's first, every one listed and never collapsed into `+N` (amber `SIN ARS` chip and 70 % opacity when it is not accepted), a fixed-height metrics strip (open orders in lime with `· N en ARS`, fee %, sats range abbreviated `5k–2M` plus the fiat equivalent when the node publishes a rate; `—` for any missing figure, shimmer skeletons while loading, never a spinner) — before "do I trust it?" (custody `Lightning` / `Cashu · <mint>` and the bond: `Bond: no compatible` blocks selection because this client cannot post a bond); the operator's `about` leaves the card. Open orders are counted by the app from kind 38383 `pending` events per `mostro_pubkey` and fiat, and the fee / limits / currencies / escrow / bond come from each node's kind 38385, both fetched in two batched relay queries by `rust/src/api/node_stats.rs::fetch_mostro_node_stats` (pure helpers unit-tested); a node counts as unreachable with no 38385 heartbeat in 30 min and no open order (mostrod republishes the info event every 300 s; in Cashu mode it publishes none, hence the order fallback). Tapping a card selects it (haptic, radio fills 0.9 → 1 in 150 ms) and the sheet closes itself after 200 ms — no confirm button; with a trade in progress a confirmation sheet explains that the trade stays on the old node. Tapping the pubkey copies it; long-press removes a custom node. The dialog (`add_custom_node_dialog.dart`) sets the key in Manrope with a lime focused underline, shape-validates on blur (`Esta no es una clave pública válida.`), keeps `Agregar` disabled until the key looks valid, and warns `Verifica la clave con el operador…`. The six-line amber disclaimer becomes two lines at the foot. Tokens in `NodeSelectorPalette` (+ contrast test), pure rules in `node_selector_rules.dart`, goldens `node_selector_9a_sheet_*` / `node_selector_9b_dialog_*`.
- [x] T046f Redesign settings and four of its screens per `design_handoff_configuracion/README.md` (10a settings, 10b relays, 10c NWC wallet, 10d push notifications, 10e logs): the nine equal cards become four group cards (`Aplicación`, `Pagos`, `Red`, `Ayuda`) whose rows replace the subtitle — which repeated the title (`Relays · Administrar conexiones de relay`) — with the setting's **current value** flush right, and the value is the only place the list warns from: amber `Sin configurar` / `Sin conectar` / `n de m conectados`, lime only when every enabled relay is connected. `Moneda fiat predeterminada` → `Moneda fiat`; icons drop from lime to `#7E899E` so the lime is left for state; the app version sits at the foot for support; `Tu clave` is **not** added — the npub already lives on the account screen. Relays leave the settings accordion for their own screen (10b, `AppRoute.relays` stops redirecting): a summary card saying what the tally means (`Recibes órdenes y mensajes con normalidad`, amber `Puedes dejar de ver órdenes nuevas` below two connected), then one row per relay with its own dot, status line and toggle — the v2 card showed a green dot even on the relays that were down. Disabling or removing the last active relay is refused with a note saying why — the core's `remove_relay` rejects it (`LastRelay`) — and a relay switched off stays listed as inactive although the core has dropped it. The `Lento` label is omitted because `RelayInfo` carries no latency (`RelayHealth.slow` exists for when the connection manager publishes one). `ConnectWalletScreen` and `WalletSettingsScreen` collapse into one `NwcWalletScreen` (10c) with two states — a setting, not a wizard: the explainer says what the wallet is *for*, the field shows the real `nostr+walletconnect://…` scheme, `Pegar` validates the clipboard before filling, `Escanear QR` connects straight from a valid code, and a footnote answers where the URI is stored (on this device only — not encrypted: `NwcNotifier` keeps it in SharedPreferences). Notifications (10d) become one group card at 13/600 with the glyph centred on the text block, plus an amber banner and inert rows when the OS permission is denied; the preferences move out of the screen's local state into `notificationPrefsProvider` so 10a can count them under the keys `push_notification_service.dart` gates on. Logs (10e) get three levels in colour (`INFO` lime, `WARN` amber, `ERR` coral — the old blue `INFO` was the only visible level), subsystem filter chips, per-minute time separators, tap-to-expand entries, a `Nuevos registros` chip when a new entry arrives while the user has scrolled back, and the unlabelled app-bar switch becomes a footer row that states its cost. The redesign's app bar moves to `lib/shared/widgets/redesign_app_bar.dart` and the dashed `+ Agregar` outline to `lib/shared/widgets/dashed_border.dart`, both shared with the order screens. Tokens in `SettingsPalette` (+ contrast test), pure rules in `settings_rows.dart` / `log_export.dart`, live relay list in `relaysProvider`, goldens `settings_10a`–`settings_10d`.
- [x] T046g Redesign the trades and chat tabs per `design_handoff_operaciones_chat/README.md` (11a my trades, 11b chat). **11a:** the list groups by what a trade asks of the user — needs your action (`tradesGroupNeedsAction`) → in progress → closed, each with its count, an empty group not drawn, newest first — instead of by date. Each card makes the amount the headline (Manrope 21, sats beside it: exact once the daemon fixed `amount_sats`, `≈` from `exchangeRateProvider` before, `—` for a cancelled trade), replaces "Selling Bitcoin" with "You sell to <alias>" (`tradesDirectionSell` + `tradesCounterpartyTo`), keeps a single chip in the palette (your turn lime, waits amber, closed neutral, in dispute coral — `tradeListChip*`) and drops the created-by / taken-by chip, which changed nothing the list offers. A trade that needs the user gets the lime border and the verb that opens its step (`tradeVerb*`: add invoice, pay invoice, send payment, release sats, rate). Group, chip and verb come from `TradeView.of` — the trade screen's own mapping — through `TradeRowState` (`trades_list_rules.dart`), so the list, the screen and the tab badge cannot disagree; the trades tab badge counts exactly the needs-action group (`needsActionCountProvider`), and a haptic fires for every trade entering it (`needsActionIdsProvider`). A dispute stays in progress: viewing it is navigation, and nothing tells when the admin asks the user for something. Rows sort by `startedAt`: the trade carries no last-activity timestamp. The filter shows the value alone (`tradeListFilter*`: all, active, completed, cancelled), picked from a sheet and persisted (`trades_list_filter`). Groups animate their height and fade in (240 ms). **11b:** messages / disputes become a segmented control with pending counts; conversations group into active trades and closed (72 % opacity), newest message first, and the list folds incoming messages in live. A row shows an avatar tinted by the trade's state (never by a hash of the key) with the lime dot of an open trade, the alias, a context line composed from the trade model (`chatContext*` + `chatTurn*`, e.g. "You sell 55 BOB · your turn to release", past tense once the trade has ended) that replaces the subtitle repeating the alias, the last message (`chatYouLabel` prefix; bold with a lime badge while unread, cleared optimistically on open) and a footnote on why conversations do not pile up. A conversation whose trade has ended (`isTradeFinished`: completed — rated or not —, admin-settled, cancelled, expired) opens read-only, the composer replaced by `chatClosedNotice` — a `success` only once its one-hour grace window is over (#642): until then it stays among the active conversations with its composer, decided on the persisted row (`TradeRow.rowStatus`, `completedAt`). Disputes use the same row with the dispute chip and who opened it and when. `TabAppBar` (menu, the app name in text, bell — since #770 the mascot, in all three tabs), `GroupHeader` and `CountBadge` are shared by both tabs. Tokens in `ActivityPalette` (+ contrast test), goldens `trades_11a_*`, `chat_11b_*`. Unread counts were already persisted by the Rust message store (`is_read`).
- [x] T046h Redesign the two invoice screens per `design_handoff_factura_lightning/README.md` (13a the buyer's invoice, 13b the seller's hold invoice), one screen per role whichever side took the order. Both: titles name the user's action (`invoiceReceiveTitle` / `invoiceLockTitle`); the order id shrinks to `#` + eight characters in the app bar and copies the whole UUID on tap; the amount is the hero (Manrope 38, grouped by the locale like every other amount — #720 replaced the original "no separator up to five digits, thin space above"); an amber time band counts down to the step's deadline and turns red and pulses under a minute. The deadline is the daemon message that opened the step plus the node's `expiration_seconds` (mostrod times a waiting step from `taken_at`), read through the new `api::invoice::trade_step_started_at` — not the 38383 `expires_at`, which is the pending order's lifetime; one ticker per screen (`InvoiceClock`). At 00:00 the band stops counting and says what mostrod is about to do with the order (`stepElapsedNotice`): return it to the book when the taker owes the step — the buyer's invoice on a sell order, the seller's payment on a buy order — and cancel it when the maker does (`invoice_rules.dart::stepExpiry`, after mostrod's `scheduler.rs`); while the order's side is not known yet it only says the step is about to close (`invoiceStepElapsed`). Nothing else on the screen changes. With no time-up view left, both screens leave for home on their own an order that ended while they were closed (opened later from a notification): its status reads cancelled (`invoiceOrderCancelled`), or `pending` again once mostrod put it back in the book and wiped the trade, confirmed against the persisted trades (`participatingRole`) because a maker's own order reads `pending` too. The countdown is the client's estimate of the node's window, not its verdict: mostrod's scheduler acts tens of seconds later and accepts the invoice or the payment until then, so the screen leaves only when the daemon's cancel arrives, through the same listeners as any other cancel (#569). **13a:** the context line names the fiat and the node; the field accepts an invoice or a Lightning address (new placeholder), with paste and scan beside its label, and a validation row right under it: the input is judged by the one Rust judge of payment destinations (`api::invoice::classify_payment_destination` / `check_buyer_invoice`, on `lightning-invoice`) after a 300 ms debounce: a BOLT11 is decoded (signature checked) and compared against the trade amount in msat (a sub-sat remainder is never rounded into a match), its expiry, the node's `invoice_expiration_window` (mostrod refuses an invoice with less lifetime left than that — `invoiceErrorExpiresTooSoon` names the minutes) and the node's `lnd_networks` (an invoice for another chain is refused), each failure with its concrete reason (`invoiceError*`); a `user@domain` address (LUD-16) is accepted, lower-cased, and resolved on submission with the trade amount (an LNURL is not: the submission path does not resolve it). Dart keeps only the row model (`InvoiceCheck`, mapped from the bridge verdict) — it classifies nothing itself. Submit stays disabled while the core judges and until the field validates; the verdict is judged again when the node's metadata resolves, when the invoice is about to run into the window, and once more at submission, so a stale "valid" never sends; without the core the daemon judges. `orders::send_invoice` and the NWC payer use the same classifier: the daemon receives the normalized destination (scheme stripped, address lower-cased), and anything that is neither an invoice nor an address raises `InvalidInvoice` locally. A counterpart card shows the seller's pseudonym with `★ rating` or `no trades`, and what the buyer pays. **13b:** amount and QR share one card; the context line gives the Mostro fee the hold invoice includes, recovered from the node fee with mostrod's split-fee formula (`holdInvoiceFee`); a note explains what "hold" means; `Open in my wallet` is the only lime action — when no app handles `lightning:` it drops to secondary and `Copy` takes its place, with no error; copy turns its icon into a check for 1.2 s; cancel is red. The NWC branches keep their flow. Tokens in `InvoicePalette` (+ contrast test), rules in `invoice_rules.dart` (+ unit tests), goldens `invoice_13a_*`, `invoice_13b_*`.
- [x] T046i Rework the 13a invoice field per `design_handoff_campo_factura/README.md` (17a empty, 17b filled) in `lib/features/order/widgets/invoice_input_field.dart`. Empty, the field asks to be filled: lime fill, a 1.5 border pulsing every 2.4 s with a halo at its peak, a blinking lime cursor and the imperative label `invoiceFieldPromptLabel`; the pulse stops for good on first focus or content and never runs under reduced motion (border held at the peak). The text area is fixed at 78 dp (three lines, Manrope 12.5); idle, the invoice is cut with an ellipsis and a long press opens it whole in a scrollable sheet; the controller keeps the full string. Filled, the label becomes `invoiceFieldFilledLabel` with a check and the decoded amount of a valid invoice. The icon actions become two labelled buttons: `Paste` (lime, `Replace` once filled) and `Scan`. `Paste` is offered only when `Clipboard.hasStrings()` says there is text (re-asked on resume; always on web) — the content is not read to decide, which would trigger the OS paste notice on every visit. No autofocus, no paste on focus. `normalizeInvoiceInput` now strips all whitespace (a mailed invoice's line breaks) and the field denies whitespace input. The disabled `Send invoice` takes the handoff's tokens. New tokens in `InvoicePalette` (+ contrast; the handoff's placeholder `#6C7789` fails AA on the text area, `#7E899E` is used), widget tests `invoice_input_field_test.dart`, goldens `invoice_13a_empty_*`.
- [x] ~~T047~~ **Superseded by T046d** (kept for history; the layout below no longer exists). Implement take order screen in `lib/features/order/screens/take_order_screen.dart`: AppBar "SELL ORDER DETAILS"/"BUY ORDER DETAILS". 5 info cards: (1) description + fiat/currency/flag/price/premium, (2) payment method, (3) creation date, (4) order ID with copy icon (📋), (5) creator reputation (rating ⭐, reviews 👤, days 📅). Countdown timer (circular progress + "Time remaining: HH:MM:SS"). Bottom: Close (green outline) + Buy/Sell (green filled). For range orders: amount input appears above buttons before showing take-action modal. Routes: `/take_sell/:orderId` and `/take_buy/:orderId`.
- [x] T048 [P] Implement range amount modal in `lib/features/order/widgets/range_amount_modal.dart`: centered dialog with title, numeric input (green cursor), helper text "Min: X – Max: Y [currency]", Cancel + Submit buttons. Submit disabled until amount in range. Error message if out of range.
- [x] T049 Implement take order actions in `rust/src/api/orders.rs`: add `take_order(order_id, role, fiat_amount)` — sends `take-sell` or `take-buy` `MostroMessage` via NIP-59. Returns `TradeInfo` with initial state. Errors: `OrderAlreadyTaken`, `OutOfRange`, `ProtocolError`, `Timeout`.
- [x] ~~T050~~ **Superseded by T046d** — the take navigation now goes `Take order` → trade detail as the stack base → add/pay invoice; `OrderAlreadyTaken` and expiry disable the button in place instead of returning to the order book. Original text: on confirm → call `take_order()` → for buyer: navigate to `/add_invoice/:orderId`; for seller: navigate to `/pay_invoice/:orderId`. On `OrderAlreadyTaken` → show error snackbar + return to order book. On timeout (10s no response) → return to order book with timeout notification.

**Checkpoint**: Full take order flow: card tap → take-order screen → `Take order` → range modal (if applicable) → invoice step over the trade detail.

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 — Trade Execution: Buyer Flow (Priority: P1)

**V1 ref**: Sections 9, 11 (`TRADE_EXECUTION.md`, `ORDER_STATES.md`)

**Goal**: Buyer adds Lightning invoice (manual or NWC), trade goes active, buyer taps Fiat Sent, seller releases, buyer receives payment.

**Independent Test**: Take a sell order without NWC → Add Invoice screen appears with sats + fiat amounts → enter invoice → trade goes active → Trade Detail shows Fiat Sent button → tap Fiat Sent → status updates to "Fiat sent".

- [x] T051 Implement trade session management in `rust/src/mostro/session.rs`: per-trade state (`Session` struct: order_id, role, trade_key_index, shared_key, admin_shared_key, peer). `create_session()`, `update_session()`, `get_session()`, session timeout cleanup (10s for take actions). ECDH shared key computed when peer pubkey received from Mostro (`hold-invoice-payment-accepted` action).
- [x] T052 Implement add lightning invoice screen in `lib/features/order/screens/add_lightning_invoice_screen.dart`: AppBar with order context. Single rounded card: info text "Enter a Lightning Invoice of [sats] Sats equivalent to [fiat] [currency]..." + multi-line invoice text input (dark bg, rounded, floating label "Lightning Invoice"). If default Lightning address in settings → pre-fill. Cancel (text button gray) + Submit (green filled). Route: `/add_invoice/:orderId`. Shown when NWC is NOT configured for buyer taking sell order.
- [x] T053 [P] Implement NWC invoice widget in `lib/shared/widgets/nwc_invoice_widget.dart`: auto-generates Lightning invoice via NWC when wallet connected. Shows loading state. On invoice ready → `onInvoiceConfirmed(invoice)` callback. On failure → `onFallbackToManual()` callback.
- [x] T054 [P] Implement LN address confirmation widget in `lib/shared/widgets/ln_address_confirmation_widget.dart`: shows "Confirm: send sats to [address]" with Confirm + Change buttons. Used when user has default Lightning address and NWC is not configured.
- [x] T055 Implement invoice submission action in `rust/src/api/orders.rs`: add `send_invoice(order_id, invoice_or_address, amount_sats)` — sends `AddInvoice` `MostroMessage` to Mostro. On failure: `on_payment_failed` stream event.
- [x] T056 Implement trade detail screen in `lib/features/trades/screens/trade_detail_screen.dart`: AppBar "ORDER DETAILS". 5 cards: (1) trade summary "You are buying [sats] sats for [fiat] [currency] [flag]", (2) payment method, (3) creation date, (4) order ID + copy, (5) instructions + status label. Countdown widget (color-coded as time elapses). Action button rows derived from `OrderState.getActions(role)`. Watches `orderNotifierProvider(orderId)` for live state. Since the redesign the chat card sits pinned above the scrolling content (`trade_detail_screen.dart`, `_pinnedChat`) whenever the trade has a chat: open while the trade is active, fiat-sent, disputed or paying out, and during a completed trade's hour (#642); once the conversation has ended (cancelled after it was active, or completed more than an hour ago) it stays pinned but closed (`tradeChatClosed`), keeps its unread count as the chat list does, and its tap opens the room read-only; turning closed with the screen open is announced once (`tradeChatClosedAnnouncement`). Open or closed is `chatRowStateProvider`, the chat list's own rule. Before the trade is active the lock note (`TradeChatLockedLine`) stays in the scroll, always the list's first child so the children below keep their state when the card takes the top. The card's and the note's transitions are skipped when the platform disables animations. On a waiting step (`waiting-buyer-invoice`, `waiting-payment`) the countdown's note says what expiry does to the order, the same text for both sides: `tradeTimerExpiryBackToBook` when the taker owes the step, `tradeTimerExpiryCancelled` when the maker does (`stepExpiry`); with the order's side not known yet there is no note. At 00:00 the note becomes the same notice as the invoice screens (`stepElapsedNotice`), and the step's actions stay until the daemon's cancel arrives (#569).
- [x] T057 [P] Implement trade info cards widget in `lib/features/trades/widgets/trade_info_cards.dart`: reusable components for the 5 info cards used in trade detail. `OrderIdCard` with copy-to-clipboard. `InstructionsCard` with green lightning bolt icon + instructional text based on role + status. _(Historical: `trade_info_cards.dart` is gone since #724. The id is the ID row of DS-CMP-22 — `OrderIdRow` / `OrderIdValue` in `lib/features/order/widgets/order_detail_cards.dart`, in the trade screen's own ID card — and the role- and status-based instructions are the title and body of `TradeStepBlock` (`lib/features/trades/widgets/trade_step_block.dart`).)_
- [x] T058 [P] Implement Mostro reactive button in `lib/shared/widgets/mostro_reactive_button.dart`: button that shows spinner while waiting for Mostro response, success check on completion. On failure, the caller reports the error via SnackBar (`onError`) and the button stays disabled for 4s (matching the SnackBar's default duration) with no visual change, then returns to idle.
- [x] T059 Implement fiat-sent action in `rust/src/api/orders.rs`: add `send_fiat_sent(order_id)` — sends `FiatSent` `MostroMessage`. Updates local `Trade.current_step` to `FiatSent`. Streams: `on_trade_updated(order_id)` emits new `TradeInfo`.
- [x] T060 Wire buyer trade detail buttons per FSM: active state → primary CTA FIAT SENT (green filled) + a secondary row of outlined destructive buttons CANCEL (red) and DISPUTE (red) below it. Contact is provided by the persistent chat chip, not a dedicated button. Fiat Sent tap → `send_fiat_sent()` → reactive button flow. Chat chip → `/chat_room/:orderId`. AppBar also carries a `⋮` overflow menu, scoped to a single "Share order" (coming soon) item — separate from the Cancel/Dispute/Release secondary row.

**Checkpoint**: Full buyer flow: add invoice → active trade detail → Fiat Sent → status changes to "Fiat sent". Cancel and dispute buttons visible.

---

## Phase 9: User Story 7 — Trade Execution: Seller Flow (Priority: P1)

**V1 ref**: Sections 12, 17, 18 (`TRADE_EXECUTION.md`, `NWC_ARCHITECTURE.md`)

**Goal**: Seller pays hold invoice (QR or NWC auto-pay), trade active, buyer sends fiat, seller sees Release button, confirms → sats released.

**Independent Test**: Take a buy order without NWC → Pay Invoice screen with QR code appears → "pay" manually → trade goes active → seller sees "Active order" instructions → buyer marks fiat sent → seller sees RELEASE → confirmation modal → Yes → success screen.

- [x] T061 Implement pay lightning invoice screen in `lib/features/order/screens/pay_lightning_invoice_screen.dart`: AppBar "Pay Lightning Invoice". White card with info text "Pay this invoice of [sats] Sats..." + QR code (centered, scannable) + **"Pay with Lightning wallet"** button (full-width green, bolt icon) + Copy button (green) + Share button (green, wired via share_plus) + Cancel button (red). Route: `/pay_invoice/:orderId`. Shown to seller when NWC is NOT configured or on NWC fallback. Real invoice loaded via `tradeInfoStreamProvider(orderId)` polling `listTrades()` every 1s until `holdInvoice != null`.
- [x] T061a Implement "Pay with Lightning wallet" wallet-handoff button in the same screen: taps launch `Uri.parse('lightning:$invoice')` via `url_launcher` with `LaunchMode.externalApplication`; on `launchUrl` returning `false` or throwing, show a SnackBar with l10n key `noLightningWalletFound`. Add `url_launcher: ^6.3.1` to `pubspec.yaml`. Add `<queries>` intent for `<data android:scheme="lightning"/>` to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` so Android 11+ package visibility lets the launcher resolve external wallets.
- [x] T061b Add live status listener in `pay_lightning_invoice_screen.dart`: `ref.listen<AsyncValue<OrderStatus>>(tradeStatusProvider(orderId))` with a one-shot `_navigated` guard. On `active | fiatSent | settledHoldInvoice | success | dispute` → `context.go(/trade_detail/:orderId)`. On `canceled | cooperativelyCanceled | canceledByAdmin | expired` → SnackBar + `context.go(/home)`. Simplify `_onPaymentDetected` (NWC success callback) to only flip `_waiting = true` so both QR and NWC paths converge on the mostrod-confirmed status transition instead of the local wallet's success reply. Satisfies FR-030a / FR-030b.
- [x] T062 [P] Implement NWC payment widget in `lib/shared/widgets/nwc_payment_widget.dart`: single "Pay with Wallet" button (large green, wallet icon). Shows loading spinner during payment. `onPaymentSuccess` fires the shared status-listener-driven navigation (T061b); `onFallbackToManual` flips the screen into manual QR mode.
- [x] T063 [P] Implement pay invoice widget (manual QR mode) in `lib/shared/widgets/pay_lightning_invoice_widget.dart`: QR code display using `qr_flutter`, copy button, share button (wired via share_plus). `onSubmit` (user confirms manual payment), `onCancel` callbacks.
- [x] T064 Extend trade detail screen in `lib/features/trades/screens/trade_detail_screen.dart` for seller fiat-sent view: Card 5 instruction text becomes "The buyer [handle] has confirmed they sent you [fiat] [currency] using [method]. Once you verify, release the sats." Status label: "Fiat sent". Primary CTA: Confirm & release sats (green filled, opens the confirmation modal). Secondary row below it: outlined CANCEL (red) and DISPUTE (red). Contact is provided by the persistent chat chip, not a dedicated button (there is no CLOSE button in this state). AppBar also carries a `⋮` overflow menu, scoped to a single "Share order" (coming soon) item — separate from this secondary row.
- [x] T065 Implement release confirmation dialog in `lib/features/trades/widgets/release_confirmation_dialog.dart`: centered modal on dark overlay. Large gray info icon. Title "Release Bitcoin". Body "Are you sure you want to release the Satoshis to the buyer?" No (gray) + Yes (green) buttons.
- [x] T066 Implement release order action in `rust/src/api/orders.rs`: `release_order(order_id)` validates FiatSent status, builds Release MostroMessage via NIP-59 gift wrap and publishes to relay pool via `publish_event_json()`. Also added `fiat_sent`, `release`, `cancel`, `add_invoice` action builders to `mostro/actions.rs`. `send_fiat_sent`, `send_invoice`, and `take_order` are wired to dispatch (fire-and-forget with optimistic local return). `create_order` instead waits for the daemon's confirmation and returns an error on no response (no optimistic local persist).
- [x] T067 Wire seller active view in trade detail: active status + seller role → primary area shows a disabled "waiting for the buyer" state (no RELEASE, no FIAT SENT), with a secondary row of outlined CANCEL (red) and DISPUTE (red) below it; Contact is provided by the persistent chat chip (no CLOSE button in this state). Seller card 5 instruction: "Contact the buyer [handle] with payment instructions." Status: "Active order". Role and status derive from reactive providers (`tradeRoleProvider`/`tradeRoleFromDbProvider`, `tradeStatusProvider`) — no local `_isBuyer`/`_status`. Real trade state arrives via incoming kind-14 routing (`dispatch_mostro_message` → in-memory order book + trade DB), which the providers poll. AppBar also carries a `⋮` overflow menu, scoped to a single "Share order" (coming soon) item — separate from the secondary row.
- [x] T068 Wire seller release flow: RELEASE tap → confirmation dialog → Yes → `orders_api.releaseOrder(orderId)` via Rust bridge → on success → navigate to rate screen `/rate_user/:orderId`. Buyer FIAT SENT button also wired to `orders_api.sendFiatSent(orderId)`. Buyer add-invoice screen wired to `orders_api.sendInvoice()`. All `Future.delayed` stubs replaced.

**Checkpoint**: Full seller flow: pay hold invoice (both QR and NWC paths) → active → fiat sent by buyer → Release confirmation → trade completes and navigates to rating.

## Phase 10: User Story 8 — Encrypted P2P Chat (Priority: P1)

**V1 ref**: Sections 19–20 (`P2P_CHAT_SYSTEM.md`)

**Goal**: Per-trade encrypted chat with text + encrypted file attachments. Unread badges on Chat tab. Trade info + user info panels (the shared key is not displayed; it goes to the solver in one tap from the dispute chat, #415).

**Independent Test**: Open CONTACT on active trade → chat room with peer handle + avatar. Send text → appears immediately (optimistic). Attach image → uploads encrypted → appears as image preview. Chat tab badge increments on new message, clears on open.

- [x] T069 Implement file encryption in `rust/src/crypto/file_enc.rs`: `encrypt_file(bytes, key)` → `[nonce:12][ciphertext][tag:16]` using `chacha20poly1305`. `decrypt_file(encrypted_bytes, key)` → plaintext bytes. Key derived from ECDH shared key + file-specific nonce.
- [x] T070 Implement Blossom HTTP client in `rust/src/nostr/blossom.rs`: `upload_blob(encrypted_bytes, mime_type, server_url)` → Blossom URL. `download_blob(url)` → encrypted bytes. Server list: blossom.primal.net, blossom.band, nostr.media, blossom.sector01.com, 24242.io, nosto.re. Try each in order on failure. Max 25MB. Kind-24242 auth event is signed and attached as `Authorization: Nostr {base64}` (BUD-02). **Note**: rewritten for v1 compatibility in #589 phase 1 (`/upload`, a throwaway key per upload, v1's server list, hash-checked downloads); the chat UI calls it since phase 2a (T080/T081).
- [x] T071 Implement messages API in `rust/src/api/messages.rs` per `contracts/messages.md`: `send_message(trade_id, content)`, `get_messages(trade_id)`, `mark_as_read(trade_id)`, `get_unread_count()`, `send_file(trade_id, file_bytes, file_name, mime_type)`, `download_attachment(message_id)`. Streams: `on_new_message(trade_id)`, `on_unread_count_changed()`, `on_attachment_progress(message_id)`. `send_message` looks up the session, wraps via NIP-59 gift wrap (kind 1059) to the peer pubkey, and publishes to the relay pool (falls back to local-only if the session/peer is not yet known). Incoming routing is implemented: `subscribe_incoming_chat` decrypts inbound gift wraps → message store → fires `on_new_message` so the UI reacts. **Note**: `send_file`/`download_attachment` are called from the chat room since #589 phase 2a (see T080/T081).
- [x] T072 Implement nym avatar widget in `lib/shared/widgets/nym_avatar.dart`: colored circle background (HSV hue from `NymIdentity.color_hue`), white icon from `NymIdentity.icon_index` (0–36 icon set, ALWAYS white regardless of hue — v1 bug fix per `contracts/types.md` NymIdentity rendering contract). Deterministic: same pubkey → same appearance always.
- [x] T073 Implement chat list screen in `lib/features/chat/screens/chat_rooms_screen.dart`: AppBar + "Chat" title + two sub-tabs (Messages / Disputes, swipeable). Messages tab: empty state "No messages available" OR `ListView` of `ChatListItem`. Disputes tab renders the real `DisputesList` widget (shows the empty state until dispute data is wired to the bridge — see T088). Tab description text below tabs. Route: `/chat_list`. Wired in app_routes.dart.
- [x] T074 [P] Implement chat list item widget in `lib/features/chat/widgets/chat_list_item.dart`: `NymAvatar` + peer handle (bold white) + context line "You are selling/buying sats to/from [handle]" + last message preview (own: "You: ...") + timestamp chip + red unread dot. Tap → navigate to `/chat_room/:orderId`.
- [x] T075 [P] Implement chat rooms providers in `lib/features/chat/providers/chat_providers.dart`: `chatRoomsNotifierProvider` (StateNotifier), `sortedChatRoomsProvider`, `chatCountProvider` (unread count for badge), `chatReadStatusProvider` (in-memory map). Rooms derive from trades via `chatRoomsFromTradesProvider` (peers with a non-empty `counterpartyPubkey`); `ChatRoomScreen` pushes live updates through `upsertRoom`. Not a mock.
- [x] T076 Implement chat room screen in `lib/features/chat/screens/chat_room_screen.dart`: AppBar (← + `NymAvatar` + peer handle + subtitle). Two info toggle buttons. Message list with optimistic send. `MessageInput` at bottom. Error scaffold for invalid orderId. Route: `/chat_room/:orderId`. Wired in app_routes.dart.
- [x] T077 [P] Implement message bubble widget in `lib/features/chat/widgets/message_bubble.dart`: own messages (right-aligned, purple `#7856AF`), peer messages (left-aligned, dark shade of `colorHue`), system messages (centered italic). Timestamp below bubble. Tapping a text message, or holding it for the platform's long press, opens its menu (`message_actions_menu.dart`), as in Telegram: the message stays lit above the scrim, follows the message if the chat scrolls or the screen turns (closing once it is gone), and the menu offers Copy, which confirms with the screens' snackbar; an attachment opens no menu, except the counterpart's, which offers only the reactions and opens on a hold alone, since tapping it opens the file. On the counterpart's message the menu also offers ❤️ 👍 👎 😂 😮 😢 above it and «…» for every emoji (`reaction_picker.dart`, `emoji_picker_flutter`, no recents kept); picking the current reaction withdraws it, and a reaction shows as a pill under its bubble (#690, `send_reaction` / `on_message_updated`).
- [x] T078 [P] Implement message input widget in `lib/features/chat/widgets/message_input.dart`: paperclip attach icon (spinner when attaching), text input "Write a message..." pill, green send button. Clears field after send.
- [x] T079 [P] Implement the info panels in `lib/features/chat/widgets/info_panels.dart` (#139): `TradeInformationTab` (order ID copyable, fiat and sats amounts, the trade header's status, payment method, creation date; from the trade row, then the order the header resolves; a missing figure leaves its row out). `UserInformationTab` (the peer's alias and avatar as the chat header shows them, and their public reputation; no peer pubkey). The ECDH shared-key display is dropped from scope: the key is never exposed to Dart/UI; Rust sends it to the solver over the dispute chat behind an explicit confirmation (T090, #415).
- [x] T080 Implement encrypted image message widget in `lib/features/chat/widgets/encrypted_image_message.dart`: downloaded and decrypted on arrival through `download_attachment()` (plaintext in memory only, `attachment_providers.dart`), drawn at the sender's `width`/`height`, loading and error states with retry; tap opens `AttachmentViewerScreen` (pinch-zoom, Save). #589 phase 2a.
- [x] T081 [P] Implement encrypted file message widget in `lib/features/chat/widgets/encrypted_file_message.dart`: file card with type icon, name, size (PDF, and DOC/DOCX/video from v1); tap opens it in another app, the menu adds Share and Save (`attachment_launcher.dart`: allow-listed types only, temporary copies swept on resume, start-up and identity change). #589 phases 2a–2b.

**Checkpoint**: P2P text chat works end to end — `send_message` (NIP-59 publish) + `subscribe_incoming_chat` (receive → store → `on_new_message`), peer ECDH key derivation, and the Blossom client (Kind-24242 auth) are all done. Images and PDFs send and display since #589 phase 2a (paperclip → `send_file`, bubbles → `download_attachment`). Received files open in another app or share since phase 2b. The dispute chat sends and shows them too since phase 3, keyed to the solver. The web build sends, shows and saves them since phase 4 (fetch-based Blossom, IndexedDB blob cache); "Open with…" and share stay native-only.

## Phase 11: User Story 12 — My Trades List (Priority: P1)

**V1 ref**: Section 16 (`MY_TRADES.md`, `ORDER_STATES.md`)

**Goal**: My Trades tab shows all user trades with status/role badges; status filter; tap → Trade Detail; badge on tab for unseen updates.

**Independent Test**: Create a trade → My Trades tab shows card with correct status badge + role badge + fiat amount. Filter by "Active" → only active trades shown. Tab has red dot when trade updates occur.

- [x] ~~T082~~ **Superseded by T046g** (kept for history; the list below no longer exists). Implement trades screen in `lib/features/trades/screens/trades_screen.dart`: AppBar (☰ + Mostro logo + bell). Sub-header: "My Trades" title (bold white) + "▼ Status | All" filter dropdown. Scrollable list of `TradesListItem`. Empty state "No trades" with icon. Route: `/order_book` (bottom nav tab 2). Sorted newest first.
- [x] ~~T083~~ **Superseded by T046g** (kept for history; the list below no longer exists). [P] Implement trade list item widget in `lib/features/trades/widgets/trades_list_item.dart`: card with chevron (→). Top: "Selling Bitcoin"/"Buying Bitcoin" (bold white). Below: colored status badge chip (Pending=yellow, Active=blue, FiatSent=blue, Success=green, Canceled=gray, Dispute=red) + role badge ("Created by you"/"Taken by you", blue chip). Amount: bank icon + "966 ARS" + time ago (gray small). Payment method (gray small). Tap → `/trade_detail/:orderId`.
- [x] ~~T084~~ **Superseded by T046g** (kept for history; the list below no longer exists). [P] Implement trades providers in `lib/features/trades/providers/trades_providers.dart`: `filteredTradesWithOrderStateProvider` (watches all sessions, reads `orderNotifierProvider(orderId)` for each, applies status filter). `selectedStatusFilterProvider` (StateProvider for dropdown). `orderBookNotificationCountProvider` (unseen trade update count for My Trades tab badge). **Note**: provider scaffold is in place; bridge wiring is covered by T085a–T085c below.
- [x] ~~T085a~~ **Superseded by T046g** (kept for history; the list below no longer exists). Expose `list_trades()` via the Rust bridge: add `pub async fn list_trades() -> Result<Vec<TradeInfo>>` to `rust/src/api/orders.rs` that calls `db::app_db::db()?.list_trades().await` (returns empty vec when DB is not yet initialised); run `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate` to update generated bindings; add `listTrades()` Dart wrapper. `Storage::list_trades()` already exists in the trait and `SqliteStorage` implements it — this task only wires the public bridge entry point. V1 ref: `MY_TRADES.md` §2 (Data flow & providers).
- [x] ~~T085b~~ **Superseded by T046g** (kept for history; the list below no longer exists). Wire `filteredTradesWithOrderStateProvider` to the DB: replace the hardcoded `const allTrades = <TradeListItem>[]` stub in `trades_providers.dart` with a `FutureProvider` (or `AsyncNotifierProvider`) that calls `listTrades()` from the bridge and maps each `TradeInfo` to `TradeListItem`: `isSelling = (role == TradeRole.buyer)` (buyer is taking a sell order), `status` mapped from `TradeInfo.order.status` → `TradeStatusFilter`, `role` from `TradeInfo.role` (Buyer/Seller → creator/taker using `tradeRoleFromDbProvider` as fallback), `fiatAmount/fiatCurrency/paymentMethod` from `TradeInfo.order`. Apply `selectedStatusFilterProvider` filter and sort newest-first by `TradeInfo.started_at`. V1 ref: `MY_TRADES.md` §2, §5.
- [x] ~~T085c~~ **Superseded by T046g** (kept for history; the list below no longer exists). Live status updates in My Trades list: after wiring T085b, hook each trade row to `tradeStatusProvider(orderId)` (already polls every 2 s) so the status chip updates in real time without a full list reload; increment `orderBookNotificationCountProvider` when any watched trade transitions to a new status and the My Trades tab is not currently active; reset the count when the user opens the tab. V1 ref: `MY_TRADES.md` §6 (Real-time updates).

**Checkpoint**: My Trades tab populated with correct cards, filter dropdown works, badge increments on trade update.

---

## Phase 12: User Story 9 — Dispute System with Admin Chat (Priority: P2)

**V1 ref**: Sections 21–23 (`DISPUTE_SYSTEM.md`)

**Goal**: Open dispute from Trade Detail; dispute card in Disputes tab; admin chat; resolution (both outcomes); seller can voluntarily release during dispute.

**Independent Test**: Active trade → tap DISPUTE → confirm → trade status = "Dispute" → Disputes tab shows card. Admin takes dispute → "In progress" status. Chat with admin. Admin resolves → chat locked with resolution message.

- [x] T085 Implement disputes API in `rust/src/api/disputes.rs` per `contracts/disputes.md`: `open_dispute(trade_id, reason)` sends `Dispute` `MostroMessage` via NIP-59. `submit_evidence(trade_id, text)` sends as admin-type message. `get_dispute(trade_id)`. Stream: `on_dispute_updated(trade_id)`. Handle incoming admin actions: `disputeInitiatedByYou`, `disputeInitiatedByPeer`, `adminTookDispute` (triggers admin shared key via ECDH), `adminSettled`, `adminCanceled`.
- [x] T086 Implement admin shared key handshake in `lib/shared/providers/session_provider.dart` + `rust/src/mostro/session.rs`: when `adminTookDispute` received, extract admin pubkey from event payload, compute ECDH `adminSharedKey` using trade key + admin pubkey, store in `Session.adminSharedKey`. `DisputeChatNotifier` waits for this key before subscribing to admin messages.
- [x] T087 Extend trade detail screen for dispute view in `lib/features/trades/screens/trade_detail_screen.dart`: when `OrderStatus == Dispute`: card 5 text "A dispute resolver has been assigned. They will contact you through the app." Status: "Order in dispute". Seller actions: CLOSE + CONTACT + CANCEL + RELEASE (4 buttons) + VIEW DISPUTE (full-width). RELEASE still available to seller during dispute (allows voluntary resolution). VIEW DISPUTE → `/dispute_details/:disputeId`.
- [~] T088 Implement disputes list widget in `lib/features/disputes/widgets/disputes_list.dart`: driven by `userDisputeDataProvider`. Loading spinner, error + retry, empty state (gavel icon + "Your disputes will appear here"). Used in Chat screen Disputes tab. **Partial**: widget built, but `userDisputeDataProvider` is always empty — `disputeNotifierProvider` is never populated from the bridge (no Dart caller of `on_dispute_updated`/`get_dispute`). The list therefore only ever shows the empty state. Rust backend (T085/T086) is ready; the inbound UI wiring is missing.
- [x] T089 [P] Implement dispute list item widget in `lib/features/disputes/widgets/dispute_list_item.dart`: ⚠️ warning icon + "Order dispute" + truncated order UUID + description text ("You opened this dispute" / "Counterpart opened this dispute" / resolution text). Status badge: Initiated (yellow), In progress (blue), Closed (gray). Unread dot. Tap → mark read + `/dispute_details/:disputeId`.
- [x] T090 Implement dispute chat screen in `lib/features/disputes/screens/dispute_chat_screen.dart`: app bar "Dispute Details" (v1's); "Dispute with [role]: [handle]", the status chip, the order and dispute UUIDs and the instructions are the info card's (T091, #680). App bar action that sends the solver the P2P chat key after a confirmation, then shows it as shared and can send it again (#415). Chat area (same bubble system: own=purple `#7856AF`, admin=dark gray). Message input (only shown when `status == in-progress`; hidden for resolved/closed disputes). Route: `/dispute_details/:disputeId`. On `initState` → mark as read. #143: history and live messages from `disputeChatProvider` (dispute channel only), text via `submit_evidence`, files via `send_dispute_file`; the status and solver update live from `on_dispute_updated`, and the input shows once a solver took the dispute.
- [x] T091 [P] Implement dispute messages list in `lib/features/disputes/widgets/dispute_messages_list.dart`: SliverList combining: `DisputeInfoCard` (first always, scrolls with the messages; #680: v1's card in v1's wording (`disputeWith`, v1's ID labels and chip labels) — "Dispute with [role]: [handle]" from the trade row's role and the peer's pseudonym, status chip `Initiated` / `In progress` / `Resolved` (a solver's verdict) / `Closed` — beside the title when the title's longest word fits next to it, else under it, so no word is broken — full order and dispute ids in monospace with tap-to-copy, the status sentence — opened by you against the seller/buyer, waiting for a solver, or in progress once a solver took it — and v1's instructions 1–3; none once resolved, and never the shared-key one, #415), then the resolved outcome (T093), optional "Admin assigned" blue card (in-progress + no messages), `DisputeMessageBubble` entries (sorted by timestamp, deduped by event ID), optional "Chat closed" lock banner (resolved/seller-refunded/closed). Auto-scroll to bottom on new message; the history's arrival jumps to the latest message, as v1 does on load (#680). Fed by `disputeChatProvider`; attachments render with the P2P chat's widgets and uploads follow the history (#589 phase 3).
- [x] T092 [P] Implement dispute message input in `lib/features/disputes/widgets/dispute_message_input.dart`: same pattern as P2P `MessageInput` (attach + text + send). Attachment uses `adminSharedKey` for encryption. Show spinner while uploading. Only rendered when dispute `status == in-progress`. Wired (#143, #589 phase 3): the attachment key is the raw ECDH with the solver, derived in Rust (`send_dispute_file`); a failed send keeps the typed text.
- [x] T093 Implement dispute resolved screen in `lib/features/disputes/screens/dispute_chat_screen.dart` (terminal states; since #680 the outcome scrolls under the info card instead of being pinned above the chat, and who won is read from the trade row's role, the side the card names; with the role unknown the outcome is told without a side, e.g. "Dispute resolved in buyer's favour"): when dispute `status == resolved` (admin settled buyer) → green checkmark + "successfully completed" text + lock icon + "This dispute has been resolved. The chat is closed." When `status == seller-refunded` (admin canceled) → "Resolved" badge (blue) + green resolution box "The administrator canceled the order and refunded you. The buyer did not receive the sats." + lock message. No action buttons except back arrow. Reachable since #143: `on_dispute_updated` and a `get_dispute` refresh on open feed the status.

**Checkpoint**: Full dispute flow: open → Disputes tab card → admin assigned → chat → both resolution outcomes display correctly with locked chat.

---

## Phase 13: User Story 10 — Post-Trade Rating (Priority: P2)

**V1 ref**: Section 13 (`RATING_SYSTEM.md`)

**Goal**: After trade completes both parties are prompted to rate (1–5 stars). Rating optional. Ratings appear on order book cards.

**Independent Test**: `PurchaseCompleted` moves the trade to `Success` → Rate button appears for both parties. Tap → rate screen with 5 stars. Select 4 → Submit enabled → tap Submit → screen closes. Counterparty's reputation score updated on their order cards.

- [x] T094 Implement reputation API in `rust/src/api/reputation.rs` per `contracts/reputation.md`: `submit_rating(trade_id, score)` — validates 1–5, sends `RateUser` `MostroMessage`. `get_privacy_mode()`, `set_privacy_mode(enabled)`. `get_rating_for_trade(trade_id)`. Errors: `TradeNotComplete`, `PrivacyModeEnabled`, `AlreadyRated`.
- [x] T095 Implement rate counterpart screen in `lib/features/rate/screens/rate_counterpart_screen.dart`: header "RATE" (uppercase gray). Success indicator: green double-lightning-bolt + "Successful order" text. 5-star `StarRating` widget. "X / 5" display below stars. Submit button (green filled, disabled until `_rating > 0`) + Close button (green outline, skips rating). Route: `/rate_user/:orderId`. Both parties prompted at `Success` (the buyer payout completed, `PurchaseCompleted`); `SettledHoldInvoice` is shown as payout pending and offers no rating yet.
- [x] T096 [P] Implement star rating widget in `lib/features/rate/widgets/star_rating.dart`: 5 tappable stars. Filled = `AppTheme.mostroGreen #8CC63F`. Empty = dark gray outline. Tap sets rating to star index + 1. Rating "X / 5" display.
- [x] T097 Wire rate button in trade detail screen: when `OrderState.action` is `Action.rate`/`Action.rateUser`/`Action.rateReceived` → show Rate button in `_buildActionButtons()` → navigates to `/rate_user/:orderId`. After `rateReceived` → no further actions shown.

**Checkpoint**: Both buyer and seller are prompted to rate after trade completion. Star selection enables Submit. Rating submitted without error. Counterparty stars updated on order cards.

---

## Phase 14: User Story 11 — NWC Wallet Integration (Priority: P2)

**V1 ref**: Section 14 (`NWC_ARCHITECTURE.md`, Settings Screen)

**Goal**: User connects Lightning wallet via NWC URI or QR; Settings card shows balance; trades auto-pay invoices without manual screens.

**Independent Test**: Settings → Wallet → paste valid NWC URI → Connect → Settings card shows "Connected. Balance: X sats". Take buy order → invoice step skipped, "Pay with Wallet" button auto-pays. Disconnect → manual flow resumes.

- [x] T098 Implement NWC client in `rust/src/nwc/client.rs`: parse NWC URI (`nostr+walletconnect://<pubkey>?relay=<url>&secret=<hex>`), connect to wallet relay(s) via nostr-sdk, send `pay_invoice` NWC request, handle response. `get_info()` for balance. Store encrypted credentials in secure storage.
- [x] T099 Implement NWC API in `rust/src/api/nwc.rs` per `contracts/nwc.md`: `connect_wallet(nwc_uri)`, `disconnect_wallet()`, `get_wallet()`, `get_balance()`, `pay_invoice(bolt11)`. Streams: `on_wallet_status_changed()`, `on_payment_result()`. On NWC failure: `onFallbackToManual` path in PayLightningInvoiceScreen and AddLightningInvoiceScreen.
- [x] T100 Implement connect wallet screen in `lib/features/settings/screens/connect_wallet_screen.dart`: chain/link icon. Text input field for NWC URI + QR scan button (opens `mobile_scanner` camera; paste-only on web via `platform_aware_qr_scanner`). Green "Connect" button. Success → redirect to `/wallet_settings`. Route: `/connect_wallet`.
- [x] T101 Implement wallet settings screen in `lib/features/settings/screens/wallet_settings_screen.dart`: "Wallet Configuration" title. Wallet info card (alias, status, balance). Disconnect button. Route: `/wallet_settings`.
- [x] T102 Wire NWC auto-pay into trade flows: in `add_lightning_invoice_screen.dart` — if NWC connected and `amount > 0` → render `NwcInvoiceWidget` (T053) instead of manual input; in `pay_lightning_invoice_screen.dart` — if NWC connected → render `NwcPaymentWidget` (T062) instead of QR. On any NWC failure → set `_manualMode = true` to show manual fallback.

**Checkpoint**: NWC connect/disconnect works. Both buyer (auto-invoice) and seller (auto-pay) trade paths skip manual invoice screens when NWC connected. Balance displayed in Settings.

---

## Phase 15: User Story 13 — Notifications Center (Priority: P2)

**V1 ref**: Section 15 (`NOTIFICATIONS_SYSTEM.md`, `FCM_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)

**Goal**: Bell badge counts unread notifications. Notifications screen lists trade events. Tapping navigates to relevant screen. Mark all read / clear all.

**Independent Test**: Complete a trade step → notification appears in list with correct icon/title. Bell badge increments. Tap notification → navigates to trade detail. Mark all read → badge clears.

- [x] T103 Implement notification provider in `lib/features/notifications/providers/notifications_provider.dart`: listens to `on_trade_updated` and `on_new_message` streams from Rust. Creates typed `AppNotification` objects for each event type (rating, payment, invoice, order taken, backup reminder). Persists to Sembast. `unreadNotificationCountProvider` (int, for bell badge). `markAllAsRead()`, `clearAll()`, `markAsRead(id)`.
- [x] T104 [P] Implement notification card widget in `lib/features/notifications/widgets/notification_card.dart`: layout per V1_FLOW_GUIDE.md §15: circular icon container (colored by type: ⭐ yellow rating, 💲 blue payment, 📄 green invoice, ➕ green order taken) + title (bold white 16sp) + subtitle (gray 14sp) + optional detail field (darker bg, blue left border, key-value pairs) + relative timestamp (gray 12sp) + green unread dot (top-right) + ⋮ overflow menu.
- [x] T105 Extend notifications screen (T028) in `lib/features/notifications/screens/notifications_screen.dart`: overflow menu with "Mark all as read" (green ✅) and "Clear all" (red 🗑️). Backup reminder pinned first. Tapping each notification type navigates to: trade detail, rate screen, add invoice, pay invoice, etc. per notification type.
- [x] T106 [P] Implement push notification service in `lib/features/notifications/services/push_notification_service.dart`: platform-gated FCM (Android/iOS via `firebase_messaging`) for background trade alerts. Silent push only — no message content transmitted. Service worker for Web Push. `NotificationListenerWidget` routes push tap payloads to GoRouter. Desktop: relay connection maintained by background process.

**Checkpoint**: All trade lifecycle events generate notifications. Bell badge counts correctly. Tap → correct destination screen. Mark all read / clear all works.

---

## Phase 16: User Story 14 — Settings & Preferences (Priority: P2)

**V1 ref**: Section 14 (`SETTINGS_SCREEN.md`, `NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS.md`, `LOGGING_SYSTEM.md`)

**Goal**: 8 settings cards; all preferences persist; Lightning address pre-fills in trade flows; relay toggle works.

**Independent Test**: Set default fiat to MXN → create order → MXN pre-selected. Set Lightning address → take sell order without NWC → address pre-filled. Toggle relay off → relay list shows disconnected. Language change → UI reflects new locale.

- [x] T107 Implement settings API in `rust/src/api/settings.rs` per `contracts/settings.md`: `get_settings()`, `set_theme(theme)`, `set_language(locale)`, `set_default_fiat_code(code)`, `set_default_lightning_address(address)`, `set_logging_enabled(enabled)` (runtime-only, not persisted). `privacy_mode` field is read-only mirror of `Identity.privacy_mode` — write via `reputation.set_privacy_mode()` only. Stream: `on_settings_changed()`.
- [x] T108 Implement settings screen in `lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart`: 8 cards (Language 🌐, Default Fiat Currency 💱, Lightning Address ⚡, NWC Wallet 👛, Relays 📡, Push Notifications 🔔, Log Report 🛠️, Mostro Node ⚡). NWC card: disconnected shows "Connect your Lightning wallet via NWC" → taps to `/connect_wallet`; connected shows "NWC — Connected. Balance: X sats" → taps to `/wallet_settings`. Route: `/settings`.
- [x] T109 [P] Implement language selector modal in `lib/features/settings/widgets/language_selector.dart`: list of 6 languages (EN, ES, IT, FR, DE, NL) with native name + code. Tap → `set_language()` + `context.setLocale()`.
- [x] T110 [P] Implement fiat currency selector dialog in `lib/features/settings/widgets/currency_selector_dialog.dart`: full-screen modal, search bar (magnifying glass + "Search currencies..."), scrollable list (flag + code + full name per entry from `fiat.json`). Tap → `set_default_fiat_code()` + close.
- [x] T111 [P] Implement relay management card in `lib/features/settings/widgets/relay_management_card.dart`: inline list with green/red status dot + relay URL + on/off toggle. "Add Relay" text button at bottom. Toggle calls `add_relay()`/`remove_relay()` or `set_relay_active()`. Validates wss:// format on add.
- [x] T112 [P] Implement notification settings screen in `lib/features/settings/screens/notification_settings_screen.dart`: toggles for push notification categories. Route: `/notification_settings`.
- [x] T112a Harden the master push toggle across Settings visits: serialize the Rust/device transaction, share its pending target, reuse one process-lived status reader, apply saved opt-out before token refresh listeners, and re-check OS permission before re-acquisition with recovery after a grant. When push is off, distinguish confirmed server cleanup from outstanding registrations using a localized warning and count. Covered by provider, service, status-rule, and widget regressions; lifecycle details are in `docs/PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS.md` §7.4.
- [x] T113 [P] Implement log report screen in `lib/features/settings/screens/log_report_screen.dart`: scrollable list of `LogEntry` items (level chip, tag, message, timestamp). Toggle logging button. Share button (exports to file). Route: `/logs`.
- [x] T114 [P] Implement Mostro node selector modal in `lib/features/settings/widgets/mostro_node_selector.dart`: shows current node pubkey (truncated) + "Trusted" badge. Modal allows entering a different node pubkey or selecting from known nodes. Validates hex pubkey format.
- [x] T115 [P] Implement about screen in `lib/features/about/screens/about_screen.dart`: app version, Mostro docs link, daemon pubkey + relay list (from Kind 38385 event). Route: `/about`.
- [x] T115a Redesign About per `design_handoff_acerca_de/README.md` (12a About, 12b Technical data): 12a is one screen without scroll (scrolls only when a translation does not fit) — brand card (logo, tagline moved up from the footer, lime version pill), `APPLICATION` (`License → AGPLv3+` opens the in-app AGPL notice, `Source code → MostroP2P/app` opens the browser), `DOCUMENTATION` rows named by destination (`User guide → Spanish / English`, `Technical documentation → English`) with an external-link icon, and the always-rendered `CONNECTED NODE` card (status dot lime / yellow while loading / red when the node does not answer, node name from the registry, middle-truncated copyable pubkey, min / max / fee cells in Manrope with `—` for missing figures, unit stated once in a footnote), anchored by `Node technical data · N fields` (counted from the node's rows; retries the fetch when the node did not answer). 12b (`/about/technical`, `node_technical_data_screen.dart`) groups APPLICATION, MOSTRO, ANTI-ABUSE BOND and LIGHTNING NETWORK or CASHU ESCROW (never both) — the handoff's rows plus every field the old screen showed; no per-row ⓘ, one footnote instead; keys and URIs truncated in the middle (screen readers get the full value) with a 44 dp copy target that turns into a check for 1.2 s; `LND version` drops the ` commit=` suffix; one chain and one network merge into `Chain and network`; `Copy all data` (and the header action) copies a `label: value` block with the app version first. Both screens read one `MostroInstance`; pure rules in `about_rules.dart`, tokens in `AboutPalette` (+ contrast test), goldens `about_12a_*` / `about_12b_*`.

**Checkpoint**: All 8 settings cards functional. Language, fiat, Lightning address, relays persist and affect dependent flows. Log screen accessible.

---

## Phase 17: User Story 15 — Account & Identity Management (Priority: P2)

**V1 ref**: Section 2 (partially), Account screen (`ACCOUNT_SCREEN.md`)

**Goal**: View/copy secret words, toggle privacy mode, generate new identity.

**Independent Test**: Account screen → masked words → Show → 12 visible. Toggle privacy mode → subsequent trades use anonymous identity. Generate new user → backup reminder reactivates.

- [x] T116 Extend account screen in `lib/features/account/screens/account_screen.dart`: add privacy mode toggle card ("Reputation mode" / "Full privacy mode") calling `set_privacy_mode()`. Add "Generate New User" option with confirmation dialog: warns this creates a new identity and old backup words won't work. On confirm → `create_identity()` (new mnemonic) → `showBackupReminder()` reactivates → navigate to `/walkthrough` or home with new red dot.
- [x] T117 [P] Wire privacy mode display: when in Full Privacy mode, trade screens should not show reputation data (rating stars, review count). `orderNotifierProvider` respects privacy mode setting. Settings screen reflects current mode.

**Checkpoint**: All 3 account actions work: view secret words (backup confirmed), toggle privacy mode (affects subsequent trades), generate new identity (backup reminder reactivates).

---

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Finalize localization, responsive layouts, theme, platform-specific features, offline behavior.

- [x] T118 Complete all ARB localization files: populate all strings in `assets/l10n/app_en.arb` from all feature screens, then translate to `app_es.arb`, `app_it.arb`, `app_fr.arb`, `app_de.arb`. Include walkthrough highlight terms in all 5 languages for `highlight_config.dart`. Run `flutter gen-l10n`. Zero untranslated strings. (historical: `highlight_config.dart` was removed in #764)
- [x] T119 Implement responsive layout breakpoints in shared widgets (mobile < 600px, tablet 600–1200px, desktop > 1200px): order book shows 1-column on mobile, 2-column on tablet, 3-column on desktop. Drawer becomes persistent sidebar on desktop. Chat room shows side-panel info on tablet+. All per Constitution Principle V.
- [x] T120 [P] Wire theme toggle (dark/light/system) throughout: `set_theme()` → `AppTheme.darkTheme` / `AppTheme.lightTheme` / `ThemeMode.system` in `MaterialApp.router`. Defaults to System on first launch (dark appearance on most devices). Switchable from Settings. Both themes fully functional.
- [x] T121 [P] Implement platform-aware QR scanner wrapper in `lib/shared/widgets/platform_aware_qr_scanner.dart`: on iOS/Android → camera via `mobile_scanner`, falling back to the paste field when the camera cannot start (no camera, permission refused). On web, Linux, Windows and macOS → paste-from-clipboard text field (`qrInputFor`): `mobile_scanner` has no Linux/Windows implementation, and the sandboxed macOS app has no camera entitlement (#458). Used in Connect Wallet screen and anywhere QR scanning is needed. Where `canScanQr()` is false, a Scan QR action beside a paste field (NWC wallet; the Cashu wallet's Receive and mint dialogs, where Paste and Scan QR are `ModalLink`s) is disabled with the `qrScanUnavailable` tooltip rather than opening a second paste field; add-invoice and bond payout still open the paste form (#766).
- [x] T122 [P] Implement graceful degradation for platform features: push notifications (FCM/APNs/Web Push) → fallback to polling on unsupported platforms. Camera / QR scan → paste-only fallback on web and desktop, and wherever the camera cannot start. Biometric → disabled if hardware unavailable. All per Constitution Principle V.
- [x] T123 Wire offline message queue flushing: in `rust/src/api/nostr.rs` `flush_message_queue()` called automatically on `on_connection_state_changed(Online)` event. `outbox.rs` retries up to 10 attempts, backs off exponentially, prunes sent items.
- [x] T124 [P] Implement countdown timer widget in `lib/shared/widgets/countdown_timer.dart`: circular progress indicator showing remaining time as "HH:MM:SS". Color-codes as time runs low (green → yellow → red thresholds). Used on Take Order screen (order expiry) and Trade Detail screen (trade step timeout).
- [x] T125 Run full quickstart.md validation: build and smoke-test on all 5 platforms (iOS simulator, Android emulator, `flutter run -d chrome`, `flutter run -d macos`, `flutter run -d linux`). Verify `cargo test` passes, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean, `flutter test` passes, `flutter analyze` clean.

## Phase 18: Real Order Book Bridge + Shimmer Loading (Priority: P1)

**Purpose**: Replace mock order data with live Kind 38383 events from the trusted Mostro relay and add DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §9.1 skeleton shimmer during initial load.

**Depends on**: Phase 5 (US3 — order book UI), Phase 2 (relay pool)

**Independent Test**: On app launch the home screen shows shimmer skeletons for ~1–3 seconds, then real orders from `relay.mostro.network` populate the list. Switching BUY/SELL tabs filters correctly. Disconnecting the network while the app is open keeps the last cached batch visible; reconnecting fetches fresh orders.

- [x] T126 Add `shimmer: ^3.0.0` to `pubspec.yaml` as specified in DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §9.1. Run `flutter pub get`.
- [x] T127 [P] Implement `OrderListSkeleton` widget in `lib/shared/widgets/order_list_skeleton.dart` per DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §9.1: `Shimmer.fromColors(baseColor: Color(0xFF1E2230), highlightColor: Color(0xFF2A2D35), child: ListView.builder(itemCount: 5, ...))`. Each skeleton card: `Container(height: 100, margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 6), decoration: BoxDecoration(color: Colors.white, borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12)))`. Add l10n key `loadingOrders` = "Loading orders…" as accessibility label.
- [x] T128 [P] Implement Kind 38383 subscription loop in `rust/src/api/orders.rs`: add `pub async fn subscribe_orders()` that calls `pool()?.client().subscribe([Filter::new().kind(38383)], None)` and for each received `RelayPoolNotification::Event` calls `parse_order_event(&event)` → on `Ok(info)` calls `order_book().upsert_order(info).await` which broadcasts via the existing `tx` channel. Handle relay disconnections with auto-resubscribe on reconnect.
- [x] T129 [P] Expose `on_orders_updated()` FRB stream in `rust/src/api/orders.rs`: add `OrdersStream` wrapper struct (analogous to `ConnectionStateStream` in `nostr.rs`) with `pub async fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Vec<OrderInfo>>` that reads from a `broadcast::Receiver<Vec<OrderInfo>>`. Add `pub async fn on_orders_updated() -> Result<OrdersStream>` top-level function. Re-run `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`.
- [x] T130 Wire Kind 38383 subscription into app startup in `rust/src/api/nostr.rs`: in the existing `ConnectionState::Online` background task (already spawned in `initialize()`), add a call to `orders::subscribe_orders().await` so that the subscription begins on first relay connection and re-subscribes after any reconnect.
- [x] T131 Replace mock `orderBookProvider` in `lib/features/home/providers/home_order_providers.dart`: change `orderBookProvider` from `Provider<List<OrderItem>>((_) => _mockOrders)` to `StreamProvider.autoDispose<List<OrderItem>>` that calls `rust_api.on_orders_updated()` and maps each emitted `List<OrderInfo>` to `List<OrderItem>` (field mapping: `id`, `kind.name.toLowerCase()`, `fiatAmount`/`fiatAmountMin`/`fiatAmountMax`, `fiatCode`, `paymentMethod`, `premium`, `creatorPubkey`, `createdAt` from Unix epoch, `expiresAt`). Initial value = `[]`. Update `filteredOrdersProvider` to consume the new provider type. Remove `_mockOrders` and the `OrderItem` class — use the Rust-generated `OrderInfo` directly or keep `OrderItem` as a thin mapper.
- [x] T132 Wire shimmer into home screen in `lib/features/home/screens/home_screen.dart`: watch `orderBookProvider.when(loading: () => OrderListSkeleton(), error: (e,_) => _errorState(e), data: (orders) => orders.isEmpty ? OrderListEmpty() : orderContent(onOrderTap))`. Replace the current `Expanded(child: orderContent(onOrderTap))` with the `when` pattern. Import `order_list_skeleton.dart`.

---

## Phase 19: Bridge Stabilization & Protocol Compliance

**Purpose**: Fix all bugs blocking live order book display discovered during Phase 18 integration testing. Covers: FRB public API cleanup, Android logging setup, relay initialization, order provider initial yield, Mostro protocol corrections (Kind 38383 authorship + status kebab-case), relay pool reliability improvements, and UI error handling.

**Depends on**: Phase 18

- [x] T133 [P] Fix FRB build errors: change `get_active_keys()`, `get_active_trade_keys()` in `rust/src/api/identity.rs` and `process_order_event()`, `OrderBook::subscribe()` in `rust/src/api/orders.rs` from `pub` to `pub(crate)` so FRB does not generate stubs for types that cannot be serialized (`nostr_sdk::Keys`, `nostr_sdk::Event`, `broadcast::Receiver<Vec<OrderInfo>>`). Re-run `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate` to regenerate `rust/src/frb_generated.rs`.
- [x] T134 [P] Add Rust logging to `rust/Cargo.toml`: add `log = "0.4"` and `android_logger = "0.14"` (under `[target.'cfg(target_os = "android")'.dependencies]`). Add `#[flutter_rust_bridge::frb(init)] pub fn init_app()` in `rust/src/lib.rs` that calls `android_logger::init_once(Config::default().with_max_level(LevelFilter::Debug).with_tag("mostro_rust"))` inside `#[cfg(target_os = "android")]`. Add `log::info!/warn!/error!/debug!` calls throughout `rust/src/api/orders.rs` and `rust/src/api/nostr.rs`.
- [x] T135 Fix relay pool initialization: call `await nostr_api.initialize(relays: null)` in `lib/main.dart` before `runApp()`. Add `_watchConnectionState()` background watcher that logs every relay state transition and polls the order cache 5 seconds after first `Online` event. This was the root cause of orders never appearing (no relay pool existed at all).
- [x] T136 Fix `orderBookProvider` initial yield: in `lib/features/home/providers/home_order_providers.dart`, yield an initial snapshot from `orders_api.getOrders(filters: null)` immediately before entering the `onOrdersUpdated()` stream loop. Without this the `StreamProvider` never emits a value and the UI stays in shimmer forever when the relay subscription takes time.
- [x] T137 Fix Kind 38383 author filter: correct the understanding that the **Mostro daemon node** (not makers) creates and publishes Kind 38383 events. Makers send a `new-order` NIP-59 Gift Wrap to the node; the node publishes the Kind 38383 event signed with its own key. Update `pending_orders_filter()` in `rust/src/nostr/order_events.rs` to add `.author(*mostro_pubkey)` using `DEFAULT_MOSTRO_PUBKEY` from `config.rs`. Update `subscribe_order_and_dm_feeds()` in `rust/src/nostr/relay_pool.rs` to pass the parsed pubkey to the filter function. Update doc comments throughout.
- [x] T138 Fix status kebab-case: `mostro-core` uses `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]` on all enums, so all status values on the wire are kebab-case: `"pending"`, `"in-progress"`, `"waiting-buyer-invoice"`, `"waiting-payment"`, `"fiat-sent"`, `"settled-hold-invoice"`, `"canceled-by-admin"`, `"settled-by-admin"`, `"completed-by-admin"`, `"cooperatively-canceled"`. Fix `parse_status()` in `rust/src/nostr/order_events.rs` to match all 15 variants using kebab-case strings. Fix `pending_orders_filter()` to use `"pending"` (lowercase) for the `s` tag value. This was the primary bug: zero orders matched because the filter used `"Pending"` and the parser rejected all received events.
- [x] T139 [P] Add `ResetGuard` panic safety in `rust/src/api/orders.rs`: implement `struct ResetGuard` with `Drop` impl that calls `SUBSCRIPTION_ACTIVE.store(false, Ordering::Release)`. Use `let _guard = ResetGuard;` at the top of the spawned subscription task so `SUBSCRIPTION_ACTIVE` is always reset even on panic.
- [x] T140 [P] Relay pool reliability improvements in `rust/src/nostr/relay_pool.rs`: reduce `STATUS_POLL_INTERVAL_SECS` from 5 → 2 seconds for faster online detection. Add `tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await` after `client.connect().await` before the first `broadcast_connection_state()` call so the SDK has time to initiate WebSocket handshakes before the initial poll.
- [x] T141 [P] Home screen error state: replace the generic error widget in `lib/features/home/screens/home_screen.dart` with a friendly column containing the `errorLoadingOrders` l10n string and a `TextButton` labelled `retry` that calls `ref.invalidate(orderBookProvider)`. Add l10n keys `errorLoadingOrders` and `retry` to all 5 ARB files (`app_en.arb`, `app_es.arb`, `app_it.arb`, `app_fr.arb`, `app_de.arb`).
- [x] T142 [P] Relay management card accessibility: in `lib/features/settings/widgets/relay_management_card.dart`, add `Semantics(label: relay.isActive ? l10n.disableRelayLabel(relay.url) : l10n.enableRelayLabel(relay.url))` on the active toggle and `tooltip: l10n.removeRelayTooltip` on the remove button. Remove `final c = colors;` alias. Add l10n keys `disableRelayLabel` (parametrized with `{url}`), `enableRelayLabel` (parametrized with `{url}`), `removeRelayTooltip` to all 5 ARB files.
- [x] T143 [P] About screen snackbar: in `lib/features/about/screens/about_screen.dart`, call `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).hideCurrentSnackBar()` before showing the copy-pubkey snackbar to prevent overlapping snackbars.
- [x] T144 [P] Currency selector cleanup: in `lib/features/settings/widgets/currency_selector_dialog.dart`, remove `final c = colors;` alias (line 102) and replace all `c.` references with `colors.` directly.
- [x] T145 Make `z` tag check lenient in `rust/src/nostr/order_events.rs`: older Mostro events may omit the `z=order` tag; since the author filter already scopes to the trusted node, log a debug warning instead of rejecting. This prevents valid orders from being silently dropped.

## Phase 20: US1/US2 Spec Update — Explicit Backup Confirmation (Priority: P1)

**Spec coverage**: FR-001 – FR-013 (spec.md updated 2026-04-01); plan.md Phase 20
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (T025–T028 done)

**Purpose**: Implement the changes introduced by the US1/US2 spec revision:
(1) mnemonic fully masked by default, (2) confirmation requires explicit checkbox tap, (3) backup reminder immune to "Mark all as read" / "Clear all" / swipe.

- [x] T146 Update `_AccountScreenState` in `lib/features/account/screens/account_screen.dart`: (a) replace `_maskPhrase()` with `_fullyMaskedPhrase()` — returns `List.filled(12, '•••').join(' ')` so all 12 words are hidden until "Show" is tapped; (b) add `_showBackupCheckbox` state variable; (c) in `_loadAndRevealWords()` set `_showBackupCheckbox = true` and **remove** the `confirmBackupComplete()` call — viewing words no longer confirms backup; (d) add `_confirmBackup()` method that calls `confirmBackupComplete()` and resets `_showBackupCheckbox`; (e) in the mnemonic container add `AnimatedSize` (200ms ease-in-out) wrapping the new `_BackupConfirmRow` widget; (f) in "Generate New User" dialog reset `_words`, `_wordsVisible`, and `_showBackupCheckbox` before calling `showBackupReminder()`.
- [x] T147 Add `_BackupConfirmRow` stateful widget inside `lib/features/account/screens/account_screen.dart`: checkbox + label "I have written down my words and backed them up securely". Once checked, calls `onConfirm` callback and becomes disabled (checked state is final). Uses `AppSpacing.md` top padding, `InkWell` for tap area. Add l10n key `backupConfirmCheckbox` = "I have written down my words and backed them up securely" to all 5 ARB files (`app_en.arb`, `app_es.arb`, `app_it.arb`, `app_fr.arb`, `app_de.arb`) and update `_BackupConfirmRow` to use `AppLocalizations.of(context).backupConfirmCheckbox` instead of a hard-coded string.

**Checkpoint**: Acceptance test from plan.md Phase 20 checklist: (a) fresh install → Show → all 12 `•••` before tap; (b) tap Show → 12 words visible + checkbox visible (not confirmed yet); (c) close and reopen Account → red dot still on bell; (d) tick checkbox → red dot gone + backup reminder gone from Notifications; (e) Generate New User → red dot reappears.

---

## Phase 21: Restore Sessions & Trades from Mnemonic

**Purpose**: Track the recovery flow contract that already exists in
`contracts/identity.md` (`import_from_mnemonic(recover: true)`) but has no
implementation task in this file. Currently, reinstalling the app with an
existing mnemonic loses all trades, sessions, and disputes — see epic #142
and its sub-issues (#216, #218, #219, #220, #221, #222) for the current,
actively maintained breakdown of this work.

- [ ] T148 Implement the recovery flow per `contracts/identity.md`
      `import_from_mnemonic(words, recover: true)`: send `Action.restore`
      to the Mostro daemon via NIP-44 (Kind 14), receive order/dispute IDs,
      request details for each, sync the trade key index, and reconstruct
      the local DB from daemon responses. Recovery only applies outside
      privacy mode. **This task is a pointer, not a plan** — see epic #142
      for the up-to-date task breakdown; do not duplicate work already
      scoped there.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies — start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundation)**: Depends on Phase 1 — **BLOCKS all user story phases**
- **Phases 3–17 (User Stories)**: All depend on Phase 2 completion
- **Phase 18 (Real Order Book + Shimmer)**: Depends on Phase 5 (US3 UI) + Phase 2 (relay pool)
  - P1 stories (3–11) can proceed in priority order or in parallel if staffed
  - P2 stories (12–17) can begin after Phase 2; recommended after P1 stories are stable
- **Final Phase (Polish)**: Depends on all desired stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Depends On | Reason |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| US1 First Launch | Foundation | Identity API + walkthrough |
| US2 Backup | US1 | `create_identity()` must exist |
| US3 Order Book | Foundation | Relay + order event parsing |
| US4 Create Order | US3 | FAB lives on home screen |
| US5 Take Order | US3 | Take Order launched from order card |
| US6 Buyer Trade | US5 | Continuation of take flow |
| US7 Seller Trade | US5 | Continuation of take flow |
| US8 P2P Chat | US6 or US7 | Chat requires active trade |
| US12 My Trades | US4 or US5 | Trades must exist to list them |
| US9 Dispute | US6 + US7 | Requires active trade execution |
| US10 Rating | US6 + US7 | Post-completion flow |
| US11 NWC | Foundation | Independent wallet module |
| US13 Notifications | US6 + US7 | Trade events to notify about |
| US14 Settings | Foundation | Independent preferences |
| US15 Account | US1 + US2 | Extends identity + backup screens |

### Within Each Phase

- All [P] tasks within a phase can execute in parallel
- Non-[P] tasks must wait for their direct prerequisite within the phase
- Rust API tasks generally precede their corresponding Flutter UI tasks
- Models before services; services before screens; screens before wiring

## Phase 22: Mascot Easter Eggs

**V1 ref**: v1 hid one in the header logo — tapping it made Mostro smile.

**Goal**: The mascot has a pulse. It answers a tap, it picks up the mood of the app around it, and it marks the three dates Bitcoin remembers.

**Independent Test**: Tap the mascot in the order book's app bar → it bounces. Tap it seven times in a row → it wobbles with stars round its head. Open the drawer and drag the big Mostro down → it stretches and springs back. Empty the book → the mascot in the empty state sleeps, with a rising Z. Set the device date to 31 October → it wears a pumpkin, and a tap quotes the whitepaper.

- [x] T140 Add `lib/shared/mascot/`: `mostro_mood.dart` holds the pure rules (`MostroMood`, `MostroSeason`, `seasonOn`, the tap-streak counter and its window, `isLoopingMood`); `mostro_mascot.dart` is the widget, the mood deciding the motion (and, since T145, the sticker); `mascot_season_badge.dart` places the emoji badge against the artwork's box and maps a season to its line; `mascot_stretch.dart` is the drawer's pull-to-stretch wrapper. Looping moods (`asleep`, `impatient`) are gated behind the viewer's reduce-motion setting — an accessibility call, and what keeps a looping mascot from hanging widget tests that settle.
- [x] T141 Wire the three surfaces: the order book's app bar mascot is the interactive one (tap → bounce, seven taps in a row → dizzy) and takes its ambient mood from state the screen already watches (`orderBookProvider` still loading after 6 s → `impatient`; a completed trade on `tradeUpdatesProvider`, already alive for the bottom bar's badge → `celebrating` for 1.4 s). The empty-state mascot sleeps. The drawer's mascot stretches when pulled and wears the seasonal badge.
- [x] T142 Seasonal lines in `lib/l10n/app_{en,es,fr,de,it}.arb`: `easterEggWhitepaper` (31 October — the whitepaper, and Halloween, which a monster mascot makes its own joke), `easterEggGenesis` (3 January — the headline Satoshi put in the genesis block, a quotation from The Times that stays in English in every locale), `easterEggPizzaDay` (22 May). A tap on one of those dates shows the line once per tap streak, never once per tap.

- [x] T143 Add `--dart-define=MOSTRO_FORCE_SEASON=<whitepaper|halloween|genesis|pizza|none>` so an anniversary can be looked at without waiting a year and without moving the machine's clock, which in this app would leave signed events carrying a displaced timestamp and relays refusing them. Parsed in `mostro_mood.dart` (`parseSeason`, trimmed and case-insensitive, `none` forces an ordinary day so a badge can be checked off on a real anniversary); `resolveSeason` holds the precedence and is unit-tested both ways; `currentSeason` is what the widgets call. A release build ignores the define outright, read via `bool.fromEnvironment('dart.vm.product')` rather than `kReleaseMode` so the pure rules stay Flutter-free, so a stray define on a shipping build cannot leave Mostro in a pumpkin hat all year. The end-to-end wiring check is skipped in an ordinary run and names the command that runs it.

- [x] T144 Header mascot in every tab (#770 part 1): `HeaderMascot` (`lib/shared/mascot/header_mascot.dart`) moves out of the order book, and `TabAppBar` centres it in all three tabs (menu, mascot, bell; 22-dp glyphs, `notif` backup dot), announced as the app name. The tab hands in whether it is `waiting` (the book's first load); trades and chat pass `false`.
- [x] T145 Mood artwork (#770 part 2): each mood wears a sticker from the Mostro set (`moodSticker`: happy → waving, dizzy → confused, asleep → bored, impatient → thinking, celebrating → celebrate; `assets/images/mascot/`, 256-px webp), drawn `MostroMascot.stickerScale` (1.2×) taller over the same box so nothing around it moves, precached so the first switch draws no empty frame. The motion and its flourishes stay on top; the sticker stays under reduce motion (it is not motion). A completed trade celebrates only when `TradeUpdate.occurredAt` is within `mostroFreshEvent` (2 min) of the clock (`isFreshEvent`): a restore's replayed history is not news (#474).
- [x] T150 Trade moods (#770 part 3): `TradeUpdate` steps become cues (`moodForTradeUpdate`: active → escrow, fiat-sent → money, dispute → dispute, success and admin settles → celebrate, every cancel and expiry → cry; a cooperative-cancel request, which carries the old status, is none, and so is a status Rust only re-states — a restore, the re-read after a peer's reputation — which is dated now and tagged `TradeUpdateReason::Replayed`, and raises no notification card either; the startup sweep's cancel is the daemon's `Canceled` learned late, so it is news), and so do three app events: an order the node confirmed (→ rocket; not one parked behind a maker bond), a rating sent (five stars → love, any other → thanks, `moodForRating`) and a node refusal (`isDaemonRefusal`, the `cant_do_message` family only; a timeout or relay failure is not one → facepalm). `mascotCueProvider` (`lib/shared/mascot/mascot_cues.dart`) holds one cue until a header mascot is on screen (its tickers enabled and its route current: no route or dialog over the tab) and hands it over once if it is still news (`isFreshEvent`); it is kept alive for the trade stream and reset with the identity. Relays out of reach for `mostroOfflineGrace` (8 s; `reconnecting` counts) scare it (→ scared, a looping shiver) until one is back, and cues wait meanwhile. When several apply, `pickMood` decides: offline > dispute > other reactions > ambient > rest, newest of equals. A cue stays on show `mostroCueHold` (1.8 s). Nine more stickers in `assets/images/mascot/`.
**Checkpoint**: Nothing the easter eggs do delays, blocks or alters a real action — they are visual and local. Nothing was added to the seed-words or backup screens, where the user needs concentration rather than surprises.

## Notes

- [P] tasks operate on different files with no dependency on incomplete tasks in the same phase
- Every screen must follow `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` tokens exactly — no improvising colors or typography
- Before implementing any screen, read its corresponding `.specify/v1-reference/<SCREEN>.md` file
- `V1_FLOW_GUIDE.md` is the authoritative behavior spec — do not invent behavior not described there
- Tab labels on the Home screen are from the **taker's perspective**: "BUY BTC" shows sell orders
- `PaymentFailed` is NOT an `OrderStatus` — it is an `Action` notification; order stays `SettledHoldInvoice`
- `CooperativelyCanceled` is a **client-side UI state only** — protocol sends action notifications
- Nym avatar icons MUST always render in **white** regardless of `color_hue` (v1 bug fix, see `contracts/types.md`)
- `privacy_mode` single write path is `reputation.set_privacy_mode()` — never write `Settings.privacy_mode` directly
- `logging_enabled` is runtime-only in Rust — Flutter persists it and re-applies it on launch
- Commit after each task or logical group; stop at any checkpoint to validate independently
